coates: For a pet project, I'm looking to list out some women who were active and influential in the web from 1995-2002, and not coming up with very many. Enlighten me, please?
olivvv: Kelly Goto &amp; Emily Cotler  https://t.co/X2u96Br6BW
Tery: Just some of the women from 1995-2002 @cpulitzer @kHyal @EleanorHaas @StacyHorn @dinakaplan @marylynd @ElainePaque @hardaway @3good_things @CeciliaPagkalinawan @zurkow @laurarich @LauraBerland @lorischwab @ReneeEdel
hardaway: Started blogging in 1996 on Microsoft platform for small business. Moved from there to Blogger, to Typepad, to @Wordpress, to @Medium. Any questions? https://t.co/HjXkLgW2Tf, or https://t.co/exE34NWiec
wekarea: A lot of the people &amp; projects I worked with over this time aren't on social media or documented. Like e-2 who worked with Tomoko on Turner prize nomination or Netochka Nezvanova...
ferdeline: .@MarilynCade was the chief lobbyist for Internet policy issues for AT&amp;T during this time. A really phenomenal person... a great mentor. Here's a 2017 interview she did speaking about Internet governance around 1998/1999: https://t.co/eds23KjBnQ
ivanski: Laura Lemay aka @lemay, author of many editions of ‚ÄúTeach Yourself HTML‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeach Yourself Java‚Äù for Sams.
EllenLevy: ...adding to @cshipley list: Ellen Siminoff, Katie Burke Mitic, Marlene McDaniel, June Cohen, Jennifer Bailey, Beth Vanderslice, Joy Covey, Caterina Fake...
Lianne_R: @LindaStone
cshipley: 2/2 . . . @eilg Diane Green, Denise Caruso, @AliceHill, @kimpolese, @zephoria, Esther Dyson, @DaphneKis, @DonnaDubinsky, @HeidiRoizen , @EllenLevy , @janaegger, @lialorenzo , @mfduva, @kvox , Ann Winblad, @wennmachers , Caryn Marooney, Megan Smith, @ShelArchambeau , &amp; dozens more
cshipley: 1/2 Fantastic job at getting a lot of women to do the work for you. ;-) Still, glad to see these amazing contributors getting the recognition they deserve. Looking beyond social media, consider also the contributions of entrepreneurs such as
vdebolt: I know I‚Äôm coming in a few days late with this, but has anyone mentioned @redcrew and @emilylewis yet?
emilylewis: I wasn't public/active in the community at that time ... starting around 2007 for me. But thanks for thinking I'm "influential," Virginia üòÑ
redcrew: Thank you, Virginia. I was in learning mode during that time period. Can't speak for @emilylewis .
JaimeRLevy: 
Check out Newsweek, the New Yorker, and the Dateline piece.
JLCBamberger: Seriously? Then you‚Äôre not looking very hard.
coates: Hi. My question was clumsily worded, and I regret that part. Hope this helps clear up my intent: https://t.co/SxW5ApxmDc
sudama: @MetaGrrrl
susanmernit: Yes, dude, sure.
sarvay: There was an amazing cadre of women bloggers who beat the curve and were posting amazing writing and social commentary on LiveJournal, Blogger, etc. in the 1999-2002 window.
ravinated: In 1995, Amy Lewis created a massive index of websites related to  women's &amp; girls sports &amp; added to &amp; maintained it for 10  years. The index was referenced in many books about the web at the time. Here's one of them https://t.co/edxmSvqhKU
sjvn: Judith Broadhurtst: https://t.co/SKcSCSNoeA Also check: https://t.co/jgE7mZhu0o
mishmosh: cofounded Blogger and @Caterina cofounded Flickr. You could say Flickr invented Web 2.0 as it was one of the most dynamic, AJAX-y apps of the time.
sw: I was an early BBS and MUD developer, contributed to open source projects, helped build early ISPs, and cofounded a startup that went public in the first dotcom era.
mishmosh: :mic drop: üôåüèΩ
sw: the mic drop is that I'm still at it, still building a new startup, still refusing to be chased out üòπ
mishmosh: I spent my dropout-risk years (6-11) in govtech, a far more level playing field than tech as a whole. Probably staying forever now. Congrats on the new company!
AquteIntel: Another vote for Martha Lane Fox. Also possibly Mitchell Baker towards the end of that period.
AquteIntel: Mary Meeker
rebeccablood: Lisa (? If memory serves) had one of the first blogs: Bird on a Wire. Anyone remember her last name and/or know where she is now? @jessamyn

jonippolito: Artists were more represented on the early Web than in offline society: in 1995 8% of websites were by artists. And women were more represented among leading Internet artists on the early Web than in the mainstream art world 1/2
jonippolito: Eg, @auriea @GIFmodel @liasomething @lizvlx Joan Heemskerk (https://t.co/h6klDRUS7I), Young-Hae Chang, Eva Mattes, Janet Cohen (https://t.co/nB6NCF11Xw), Natalie Bookchin, Cornelia Solfrank, @mezBreezeDesign, Jennifer Ringley, and curators Susan Farrell and @ChristianePaul2 2/2
bokmann: Not just web, but software architecture in general - @RisingLinda. Barbara Liskov should be there too, but doesn't seem to have a twitter.  @estherderby was present at the early days of agile practices.

melissamcewen: I tagged some I could find on twitter in this tweet https://t.co/jZyw3LPvv5
corinne_podger: I bet @abigailedge and @SarahMarshall can help you out. Please publish the list somewhere useful like Medium?
corinne_podger: Probably - and I am not being funny - because internet historians forget to mention them.
ChocciesIam: Try reviewing Shara Evans Australia
agunn: Lisa Holzer was the senior editor for Yahoo Internet Life for the first several years...and Srinija Srinivasan was Yahoo-proper's Ontological Yahoo (and fifth employee).
brooklyndan: Candace Carpenter at iVillage
agunn: And one more, because this list is awfully Left Coasty: Stacy Horn, keeper of the mighty ECHO. Without her, mulpiple NYC tech scenes simply would never have jelled.
brendanmccallum: Xeni Jardin?
MRISWA42TW0: I remember a then-Apple employee named Romana Machado being active on the internet privacy front. She was mentioned in WiReD a few times.

heathervescent: Also @MaryHodder
heathervescent: I went on to do Identity based work at AOL for Instant Messenger. Was also OG at Ryze and ran the peer mentoring group there, until I moved to LA in 2004. Also OG Blogger. You likely also want to include Sylvia Paull - she ran events in SF at that time. https://t.co/lNzCK4bE2f

chx: Wasn't it Esther Dyson who practically invented ad funded websites in Release 1.0 / 2.0 ?
wendyabc: Thank you for asking this important question. While this thread may not have gone where you intended, I have found it so energizing and affirming. To all the ladies responding: I'm excited for us to tell our stories and for our names to be known. &lt;3
coates: Very happy about where it went except for the few people who assumed the worst. (-:
PaulCaris3: Jennifer Ringley.
_plinth_: 
Recall a website that was "Amanda's Days at Work" which was one of the first live webcams. Couldn't find more info, though.
Piranjade: 
https://t.co/yoTW6YFYll
bikersites: thanks for the reminder... the early days were great fun
bikersites: I have been in the web business since 1995.  Hopefully I had some influence to someone!  ;-)    wrote shell script that allowed people to answer questions and automatically make a website for them- cutting edge! which led to template sites.  Wrote an early blog program...
GreenyBeans84: I got into web design/dev back in 2000. No one influenced me except myself really. Self taught and decided this was the path for me. its now 2018 and im still a web developer.
GrrlScientist: one of my best friends, kim rollins, who is a superb writer and who was instrumental in the early development of "blogging" -- influential before that word had been coined.
kcm74: If not mentioned already, @medley, @web_goddess, @Nutmegg98, @katxena, @jessamyn, @freakgirldotcom @rebeccablood, @windowseat, @emmajanehw, @girlhacker, @GaelFC, @mihow, @listenmissy, @Caterina, @digby56, among others, are all early/old-school bloggers from the '98-'02 period.
Nutmegg98: Thanks for the mention!  Quiddity didn‚Äôt have a huge following, but I was still proud of it.
web_goddess: Thanks! Yep, still blogging. Got an older site too: https://t.co/wPCtzMM3Ls is coming up on 22 years old. I gave a talk last year with plenty of old screenshots: https://t.co/RQY3pa8u58
GaelFC: Thanks for mentioning me! Started in 1999. Also, I have a Twitter list of old-school bloggers (male and female). https://t.co/Q4lymdhdcE. And my co-worker @bonniegrrl surely qualifies!
bonniegrrl: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Yup I started blogging way back in 95 too. Started https://t.co/KkU7IprP8G in 1996. Heck, I still use Livejournal! https://t.co/xocZp9OkE4
mihow: Why thank you for remembering me! And I'm still blogging after all these years! Like it's 1999. :]
ccolohan: 
And hard to imagine that we'd have those today without the pioneering work of Nancy Lynch and Barbara Liskov.
kevinmarks: So many. @burningbird @megnut @dollarshort @jeneane @zephoria @xeeliz @mamamusings @Halley @dhowell @suw @clevergirl @stephtara @sniffles @susanmernit @blogher
sniffles: Thank you @kevinmarks @denisejacobs  :) Adding @leisa @go2girl @deyalexander @Geek_Manager @obiwankimberly @goodwitch @stefsull @hollym @vdebolt
obiwankimberly: Steph! I apologize for not mentioning you, I'm so sorry. Let's also mention Anitra Pavka!
corymchambers: If a woman is a developer but her name isn't plastered all over twitter or Wikipedia then clearly she was victim to a man who stole her work. Wow, that's a great story.
mholzschlag: LOOK WHAT YOU WENT AND DONE DID SEAN! üòçüòúü§™
coates: I wish all of the replies were as understanding, helpful, and benefit-of-the-doubt-giving as you (and many others like you) have been. Thank you again. (-:
mmurray: Carolyn Burke ( @clburke), who did one of the first online journals and cofounded one of Canada‚Äôs most important internet security companies (FSCInternet, later Assurent)

radix42: I‚Äôm going to 2nd the above shout out to Evi Nemeth‚Ä¶..she was an amazing person and also always knew where the good sushi near Usenix was
Suw: Also, if you publish anything about this, please let me know!! Most of the women in tech in that era got edged out later. :(
glazou: Sharon Adler, Lauren Wood, Mitchell Baker
bobdc: There are apparently several Lauren Woods out there, so I'll add this: https://t.co/vVcHfik0rS
christinamerge: @sarahbrown
madebypaul: of course! Floppy disk zines yo!
Reynardo_red: Alex Bayley, birth name Kirrily Robert, online name Skud.
jkarls: Most def @dollarshort. I like whoever said this should be mapped out &amp; published. 20+ years on and we still don't have a movie - come on!
auntiesiannan: Trillian Rose, @hepkitten, @girlvinyl.
andrewshumate: https://t.co/xrpMGzKvRs
amandalicastro: should be on the top of that list. I included her early work on blogs in my dissertation https://t.co/hjudY2V8yX
acm_redfox: Bitch,PHd  and Twisty come to mind. @Medley too! :)
gilbertglee: For sure @carywood
zachinglis: 
Also @mholzschlag too.
carywood: I was just thinking that in one of our conversations I saw a photo of your office, and you had @lukew's first book on your desk. That was published in 2002! This whole thread is major going down Memory Lane for me.
theRoUS: (Sally Khudairi)
nearyd: Assuming you mean women who contributed to the creation and popularity of the modern internet. Mitchell Baker, Mozilla. Allison Randal, Perl &amp; Parrot. Kim Polese, Java. Joyce Reynolds, IETF. Susan Estrada, CERFnet. Radia Perlman, STP inventor. Nicola Pellow, Line Mode Browser.
nearyd: I ran out of room, there are others.
rockitdev: Reach out to @jensimmons . I‚Äôm sure she could point you in the right direction.
hilarymarsh: @danylevy
hilarymarsh: was the first person I knew of writing about &amp; doing content strategy back then
hilarymarsh: Also, @cpulitzer and the women who created @village (sorry to say I don‚Äôt remember their names)
elisadoucette: Pretty sure @annhandley founded her first online/content marketing agency during this time?
annhandley: Yep. I founded @ClickZ in 1997. (Hi, Sean!)
sheilaellen: Social media expert @missrogue, active then and who later co-founded barcamps and the co-working movement.
missrogue: (I was active, but relatively obscure/unknown until 2004)
missrogue: Heather Champ
missrogue: @alevin
missrogue: :) I didn‚Äôt cofound Barcamp (just was active in helping spread it), but yes Coworking. :) Also: @mholzschlag @IdentityWoman @Caterina @ElisaC @ginatrapani @alizasherman @lynnjohnson @debs @alevin @doctorparadox @xeni @JoryDJ ...there are more!
melissapierce: 
Also, ask @histoftech - Lady OG's are her wheelhouse.
heathervescent: Didn't you co-found the first co-working space though? ;-)
IdentityWoman: 
Also @heathr @ultrasaurus  @sarahmei  @digitalsista @blogdiva @MaryHodder @zephoria
debs: plus... - @emilyd @softwareandart @xeeliz
ElisaC: More OGs: @rmack @MegHourihan @dollarshort @Annaleen @heathervescent @susanmernit @rebeccablood @charleneli @Halley @reneeblodgett @whoisylvia @niche @nancywhite @kanter @awsamuel @webb @dooce @lizhenry
debs: Anyone created a LadiesOG list out of this rad group? and also adding @christine
carywood: I think it saw Tara Hunt @missrogue doing a Twitter list using names from this discussion, but have no idea if she's adding everyone mentioned or not. Oh, here. @missrogue/Ladyogs.
missrogue: Link: https://t.co/oqOj3s9C92
missrogue: I‚Äôm trying to add everyone mentioned. Feel free to send me names I‚Äôve missed.
blogdiva: 
@reappropriate
missrogue: Added! Thank you!
debs: And a few more unnoticed missing for ladyOGS @judith @clevergirl @elisebauer @marcyswenson
ultrasaurus: also @jlabsllc https://t.co/BKGJNax9E7 and @Heidivt73 - Dreamweaver engineer in '90s -- for your #LadyOG list :)
mholzschlag: Marcy Sutton! @marcySutton for #LadyOG list too.
mholzschlag: Suggest if not represented  (my braindwidth is limited ü§™of late) to add @YaGirlSherriJ from @FlyDuo to the #LadyOG list - and lots more women of diverse backgrounds/families from the Atlanta area in general! #HotLanta
YaGirlSherriJ: Thanks Molly! I‚Äôd like to also include @emilylewis, @lealea, @snipeyhead, and @mulegirl to the Lady OG‚Äôs list.
alizasherman: Has anyone mentioned Women‚Äôs Wire BBS (I think it used FirstClass BBS software to access which was so fancy). Anyone here on the Twitter threads from the Women‚Äôs Wire days?
mulegirl: I was!
carywood: I have fond memories of being on a discussion list way, way, way back when with @lealea. Oh, I think that's also how I first knew about @dori and @stefsull!
lealea: Back when mailing lists weren‚Äôt for marketing blasts but for forum-like discussions ;-)
heathr: I have to admit I am somewhat amused that by @ ing a bunch of folks and then it continued and they told two friends and so on and so on we‚Äôve now shown twitter as mailing list.
Blackamazon: True but we also documented a really ignored part of internet history . Because if one more person starts internet feminist at 2009 . I‚Äôm chucking a modem
digitalsista: Yeah so that one is partly my fault. It was the year we finally got feminist orgs to organize online with fem2.0
Blackamazon: Oof . I gave you HELL on that and I am sorry truly . Not about my critique but not ever should I have launched it that hard at a BW I didn‚Äôt have personal beef with . But that was the APEX of ‚Äúwhat the fuck fam‚Äù for me. I apologize .
digitalsista: Don't feel the need to apologize. It was intended to change the landscape for feminist orgs and it did that but it wasn't the start of feminism online and it sure wasn't the story for BW online.
digitalsista: It was hard as hell to do and I walked away a bit angry about where it went but I was ready to wash my hands of it all. Then I realized folks were trying to take credit for my work and I was like NOPE!!
Blackamazon: Aint that always it
digitalsista: That train never stops showing up for us. https://t.co/fFH3urr61D
ElisaC: Shireen do you remember a Fem 2.0 conference, like 10 years ago? I don‚Äôt think it ever became a regular thing but I met a lot of great women there (and marveled at how the mainstream Fem orgs didn‚Äôt really get the web/social).
digitalsista: That's the one we are talking about. I co-founded that conference. It never happened again because the "feminists" tried to snatch the concept and not give proper credit to the WoC that pulled it off.
digitalsista: IE the train gif.
ElisaC: Yeah I thought it might be that one you were referring to...
jackaponte: Just catching up on this, thanks for the inclusion! (Started my first blog, Surblimity, in 1998! That segued into AngryBrownButch post-2002.)
Blackamazon: Love you boo but I don‚Äôt show up till 2006
blogdiva: i wasn't sure about that. thanks for the update üòòüòòüòò
reappropriate: Thank you!!
blogdiva: A CORRECTION: it's @media_girl, not the other one.
ultrasaurus: @LisaGelobter
LisaGelobter: @Heidivt73
missrogue: Got you and Heidi!
heathr: Adding @dearsarah @therealgynomite @emilydavidow @birdlord @aeleitch
digitalsista: that is what we should be doing right now.
christine: PS noting that this list of ladies (each of whom I love &amp; respect &amp; fear in some proportion, yes all of you) is super white, and looking forward to when we've finally helped change that ratio too
rebeccablood: I don‚Äôt believe the ratio was never this white, and @anildash can help with this. Will you kindly point this thread to some POC women who were active and influential in the web from 1995-2002?
blogdiva: i think y'all have missed a big chunk of the conversation. there's a list hours back where quite a number of us are included :)
missrogue: can you check my list to make sure I got everybody? I *think* I got that thread
carywood: Gah, now to find that. Crazy threads.
zephoria: Wow. What an explosion of loving awesomeness! Oh the memories. Yet as I think about this thread in relationship to the originating question, I can‚Äôt help but be reminded that...
zephoria: The untold story of women and PoC impact is often how we knit things together in ways that boys can capitalize off of for $$.
susanmernit: All too true.#changethenarrative
alizasherman: We need to knit this together in a way that we all win - and generations to come will know how and why women made tremendous impacts that positively affect everyone.
marypcbuk: technology being only the latest place where this happens; thinking of all those 'thanks to my wife for doing my maths proofs' thesis intros
lizhenry: I am in one of those as I did an incredible amount of paper/book editing and then was thanked in intro as "my wife," namelessly. We did not stay married long... I mean, wtf.
ElisaC: #grr
marypcbuk: WTAF? should have asked for a share of royalties ;)
mholzschlag: Oh, Mary! That gets a gold star for first coffee spit-take of my morning. üòú Turning it around: AS IF my nerdy medical husband could care to have taught #CSS specificity. He DID make a hella cup of coffee to send me on my workday way and was always supportive. That alone is rare.
marypcbuk: good coffee is a fantastic skill; doing fair shares of unpaid home labour even better!
marypcbuk: the thanks for typing are bad enough (I bet the typists also fixed spelling, grammar &amp; incomplete sentences for them) but proofs in math! ;)
mholzschlag: Hence the spit-take. The "proofs in maths" rammed the point right on home where it needed to go. #LadiesOG I'm impressed - longest overtly positive mass conversation with meaning and purpose Twitter has seen in a very long time.
marypcbuk: if the OP doesn't write up all of this history &amp; community, someone else will have to ;)
alizasherman: - you should revive https://t.co/rIz7ZczDs9 - all the women are finding one another on Twitter!
Tery: There are so many awesome women from early digital, I don't want any of them forgotten! Their stories are so very important. It's a lot of work, I could use the help.
sheilaellen: What kind of help would you like? (Unable to DM)
Tery: thank you so much for offering! I could use help with collecting stories. Putting the word out about @womensinternet. I just followed you we can dm now :)
lizhenry: I just remember seeing Mosaic (as the new gui interface to gopher/veronica/archie!) and having a mind blown reaction as i realized some things, and screaming to everyone in the room, "OH SHIT. THEY'RE GOING TO PUT ADS ALL OVER OUR PERSONAL COMPUTERS!!!" They didn't believe me!
lizhenry: It was like saying there would be ads on our toasters! Totally out there. Heh.
lizhenry: Not sure I did anything directly influential, but I was "there" for the super early web and before that, writing MUDs and so on.
alizasherman: &lt;waving&gt;
Tery: I want your stories! Were you on the WELL, ECHONYC or something else?
alizasherman: EchoNYC and @StacyHorn called me personally when I left asking me to stay. She was keenly aware of the lack of women in online spaces in the early 90s.
lizhenry: Then there was that time I wrote an article on lesbian sex on the internet in 1991. Result, Al the dykes in town got netcom accounts! ü§£
christine: ..and that was my very first VC deal, Netcom when it was 8 servers in Bob Rieger's bedroom! Full circle lol.
Tery: I learned so much from @StacyHorn! Was so patient helping me get through ECHONYC 1990
kanter: I have fond memories of Echo, Metanet, and the Well
blogdiva: 
I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
carywood: This has been a phenomenally exciting thread! I wish the action could be moved to some other place. At this point, the sub-threads are becoming difficult or impossible to follow and ideas will soon start to be lost. We need a forum, maybe? What do you think?
alevin: forum? google group? something other than a Twitter thread. This is very cheery but also noisy and hard to follow
blogdiva: 
https://t.co/awpv2ISGKR
carywood: Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to set up a forum myself, it's just an idea I'm throwing out there. I can't keep up with all the branches of this conversation anymore, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
coates: I get them all in my notifications stream, and even I can't keep up. It's great that so many people spoke up. (-:
blogdiva: am on it. am setting up things &amp; will ping you all this weekend :)
Annaleen: Thanks for doing that!
Tery: The Project is alive and well, but we could definitely use volunteers to make it better. Who wants to volunteer please DM me!
marypcbuk: wonder if the Computer History Museum would be able to offer support? could do w more women on their history panels https://t.co/lFS6K39K9E
Tery: Can you put me in touch with https://t.co/Rq6jZmDkpO? I'm stretch between this project &amp; work I could use the help. WIHP site is https://t.co/Uo0jh5ZXFy &amp; https://t.co/0tILKpSMRw Thank you!
IdentityWoman: We are on it.
marypcbuk: I don't have a direct contact for an intro alas, but I think the archivist who did the medium post would be right contact or? @IdentityWoman
Tery: That's a great idea! Do you have a contact there?
IdentityWoman: I have hosted @shesgeeky at CHM many times.
IdentityWoman: I said on another part of this thread. I‚Äôm up for organizing an @shesgeeky with the #LadyOGs theme in late Q1 or in Q2. We need some sponsors and to find a producer. #ladiesOG. It‚Äôs a well facilitated Unconference all topics/ideas/discussions welcome.
heathervescent: Hey @IdentityWoman let's talk and see about coordinating efforts. :-)
blogdiva: oooooh...
digitalsista: See that's the thing. We should be writing our own history.
jenmyronuk: I developed software years ago to address documenting multi-perspective storytelling (and still have the support resources -- happy to share). One of my fave examples of this approach is Andy Hertzfeld's https://t.co/ErbPUzGVXw re: early days of Mac. 2/2
heathervescent: Ladies, I threw together this survey to gather interest/names/contact info about a Jan 25 SF meetup, reunion in Palm Springs and recollecting our community. Please answer and share to other threads). https://t.co/xgWlQZdeC9
kanter: thank you Heather
blogdiva: THANK YOU!
heathervescent: My pleasure! So inspiring and so surprising. We were all here all the time and now here we are raising our voices again.
susanmernit: So excited by this energy,how can we keep it going virtually? A @Medium aggregated feed?
digitalsista: I would say we should storify all of this but we know that won't last. I do think there should be an archive of this whole conversation and all the side threads.
ElisaC: Is there a tool that can take the *original* tweet and capture that? If so, I‚Äôm unaware of it!
heathr: 
@blogdiva
ElisaC: Well, I mean all the ensuing off shoots and sub threads.
blogdiva: am in the middle of setting up a private site with collaborative tools and forums. will ping y'all this weekend
alizasherman: Incredible!!
mholzschlag: There's a reason you're the one and only true #BlogDiva Liza, and this right here is a perfect bit of evidence as to why!
blogdiva: 
it's a simple but robust setup for group work. it's not my personal distribution but heard it's good
carywood: Jaw-droppingly fabulous.
blogdiva: 
am keeping things simple now, but the good news is that we can build it up later with e-commerce, conference organizing, CRM, mailing lists, etc
digitalsista: Can't wait to see what happens. Good work mi hermana
susanmernit: YESSSSS!
rebeccablood: You‚Äôre a rock star. Thank you.
ElisaC: Co-sign...amazing!
jenmyronuk: Suggestion: I really admire the @500womensci model of setting up nodes geographically. For an OG women in tech history project, integrating a node model means more people can participate/connect with each other IRL locally, esp. as many have moved over the years.
mholzschlag: This is yummy to my eyes indeed. Multiple means of access IS truly equitable access. I like it. Will read the model when eyes are not blurrying ;-)
jenmyronuk: I think Open Atrium is a great option as both a short + long term solution @blogdiva -- and to correct myself @500womensci calls their local groups "pods" -- "nodes" are definitely a nod to Drupal. As an online::IRL organizing case study, women scientists are leading the way :)
blogdiva: 
will be posting links next...
heathervescent: I leave you to be benevolent dictator. :-)
blogdiva: mwaha... MWAHAHAHAHAHA
ElisaC: Uh oh ;)
blogdiva: https://t.co/GKjLV60tIj
christine: I suggest something lightweight and quick - this is getting too complicated to maintain positive, easy momentum. Also, note that the #ladyOGs are in theory Web 1.0 folk, so wouldn't assume Web 2-3 facility.
debs: there‚Äôs a Web 3? damn I‚Äôm always behind on the sequels. Real OG - IRC anyone? #ladyogs
heathervescent: OMG an IRC channel would be AWESOME!
christine: I got your Compuserve account right here, sister! ROFL
ElisaC: I actually feel like if you navigated Web 1.0, Web 2.0+ is a piece of cake. Web 1.0 was way more DIY.
christine: LOL exactly - ladies who worked on TCP/IP are not necessarily also social media mavens or savvy bloghers. Maybe yes of course, but hate to assume one way or the other. &lt;3
ElisaC: OK, reasonable point :)
digitalsista: Yes but some of us are and also built BBS before this web2.0 thing.
christine: the histories I really want to preserve are the ladies with punchcards and UNIX and COBOL and daisy chains....not nearly enough voice as few are on social. #Ilovemy@datamama
marypcbuk: so this is nicely relevant &amp; author even talks about how to get more women's computing history into archives https://t.co/zeyQQUm8Qr
digitalsista: This is what I feel needs to happen. It's another core piece of why there is so much bias. most of herstory isn't told.
jenmyronuk: I started working in tech in the late 90s (in a niche developers community); digitalbreadcrumbs are the only remaining relic. From 1999 - 2001, I managed a database-related magazine online, thankfully webcrawled into time capsules preserved by the @internetarchive.
kanter: I had a front row seat at the creation of nonprofit tech back in early 90's - worked as trainer for an online network of artists, ArtsWire, and later joined a movement of nonprofit techies - mostly guys, but a few women.  Was on Well, Metanet, ECHO, gophers, HTML very beginning
digitalsista: I started professionally in 97' most of my work wasn't archived. That doesn't count all that I did before that. Not to mention those that tell a different story about all I did AFTER. There are so many levels to our storytelling.
jenmyronuk: Absolutely! That's why oral history/multiple perspective storytelling is the most powerful resource we have. Even w/ the Internet Archive, only a small fraction of the web was captured as a brief snapshot in time. Raw archives do not provide context or meaning. Only stories do.
digitalsista: you know that very well.
susanmernit: We need to tell our own stories and control those narratives for sure  #ladyOGs
marypcbuk: relying on someone else seeing a woman as important enough to preserve for history because we're taught not to put ourselves forward
digitalsista: others rarely tell our stories. And it still matters who finally gets too. Just like the women of Hidden Figures.
christine: I think by default every #ladyOG was a BBS user...or IRC/Compuserve//WELL/WAIS/gopher etc LOL.
webb: The phone in the modem.  And I used Pine.  And i liked it.  Hell, I loved it.
kanter: I Pine for Pine ... and miss Eudora
debs: And Elm...
alizasherman: Eudora!!
debs: Fetch!
christine: Eudora!!!
Annaleen: Pine! Pico! The Unix talk utility!
Xtien: There's still nano...
alter_spaces: I started with Columbia MM (https://t.co/qp89TQxh2R) and then Pine.
marypcbuk: some of us were CompuServe admins ;)
estherschindler: GO SYSOP
mholzschlag: GEnie, Delphi, Prodigy, Compuserve, OG MSN and the one that took my online virginity - QLink with my Commodore 64 and a Hayes 300 Baud modem (not a coupler, I was progressive) the size of a tissue box. The Well. Fidonet. Freenets. Ah,  youth! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíöüíôüòúü§™üòÇ
estherschindler: 
Also lots of BBSes... back when that meant a really expensive long distance bill.
blogdiva: FACTS!
kanter: OMG, BBSer here too
rebeccablood: Me too.
heathervescent: I logged into the webapp version of my old BBS last year.... I can't seem to find that interface right now, but, yeah!
blogdiva: 
i don't want us to be in the situation of having to re-invent the wheel later on :P
rebeccablood: Do it the best way the first time. Should be easy to use, easy for admins to configure. Those interested will respond to an invite, even if this convo has petered off.
susanmernit: Let's make shit happen!
ElisaC: adding a few more: @sgetgood @TobyDiva @mypetblog @GinaHughes @cathesaurus
sgetgood: also @liza_kessler @csamuels both of whom were active in 90s (as was I) during early days of web regulation efforts
susanmernit: LIKE THIS, let's make shit happen!
blogdiva: 
https://t.co/sXsM8TtAYr
carywood: This is all beyond what I'm familiar with. I'm so grateful for the expertise of all the women here. This is so powerful to witness.
blogdiva: 
and subsites/subdomains can be iterated easily. not so much with a nextcloud or a standard forums setup.
carywood: Wow, yes! We need some women with large followings to come in and boost the signal of this tweet of yours. @missrogue? Can some other people tag some women in these threads so that they'll come here to @blogdiva's tweet and reply to her and see what she's doing?
carywood: I was just tweeting that @blogdiva is going to set something up. Not that more places wouldn't be great. I suggested a forum. She may already have been thinking the same thing.
jenmyronuk: The writing/gathering of history should strive to be truly inclusive &amp; value multiple perspectives, experiences. When we leave people out (happens quite often) we do a disservice to the story; history is the art of asking who was there, what did they contribute. 1/2
lizhenry: Yes! You get this so perfectly &lt;3   multiple voices, multiple stories
carywood: Yes, and multiple projects!
Annaleen: Also I feel like this should be more than chronicling history. It should be a way for women to organize across generations. We had so few female mentors in tech. But now we can be those mentors/older sisters/pick your favorite term for wise helper person.
ElisaC: Oh absolutely. Instead of a circle jerk we can have a virtuous circle.
missrogue: I love this idea.
marypcbuk: I still keep 2 'reminder you're not alone' scarfs hanging on the office wall from a conference women in tech luncheon over a decade ago
digitalsista: I do this in the background for every WoC I see struggling. It's not something I think needs to be said out loud it just needs to be done.
Annaleen: And I like the idea of combining audio/video with a book. This oral history would make a great podcast.
coates: FWIW, the original project idea that seeded this thread was one for a nostalgic podcast. Please take this and run with it. (-:
jenmyronuk: There have been many seeds for a project like this over the years -- @alizasherman started the Internet Women's History Project + @WomenAtFrontier has a #Gamechanger365 initiative -- history is best when cultivated + cared for as a shared resource for all
alizasherman: Women‚Äôs Internet History Project was actually started by @tery - I just helped a bit. So excited to see this taking off!
jenmyronuk: Yes, of course! @tery created the WIHP platform as an early advocate/catalyst for producing this type of resource -- @blogdiva if you haven't already, check out @tery + @alizasherman's archive re: stories &amp; interviews: https://t.co/HmHwJ53KlT (apologies as it's been awhile!)
blogdiva: so the initiative here is to bring all these together into a sustainable framework
debs: What a killer idea!
carywood: I love the podcast idea! We've all generated so many names that they can't be contained in one or two finite projects. Ongoing projects could mine so much more from this rich source of voices.
digitalsista: I'm already working on a podcast.
Annaleen: Awesome! Can't wait to listen.
blogdiva: exactly!
marypcbuk: it's just that the OP said they were researching for a project, not that we should leave it up to someone else
MegHourihan: hey all, super inspiring stuff here just a quick follow up that you‚Äôre looking for that meg hourihan, not me!
ElisaC: Yes somewhere along the line I realized that...sorry for the mis-tag!
ElisaC: Well, hell, that was my TEDx Talk topic...how blogs were a new way for history to be written including the perspectives that are usually left out...including almost entirely women.
mholzschlag: See, we really have all been there and done that. Women generally tend to leave little to no trace. We worry about who has to clean up.
mholzschlag: Folks were talking about number of followers. I follow almost everyone back in industry. I'm sure if you have a career and life you don't want to hear my invalid complaints. But why aren't we following each other to start with? Bump up or shuddup? (j/k but amiright?)
rebeccablood: 
I just followed everyone on it.
mholzschlag: Awesome, Rebecca! I shall do the same. This is the actual reason lists exist ;-) and forgive me, in the fray I forgot to ask after you, it's been far too long and you have always been an inspiration to me as you are truly YOU. Authenticity is attractive, hot and delightful to me.
rebeccablood: Thank you! :) I‚Äôm very well and you‚Äôre still going from success to success I see. Good to connect with you in this group.
mholzschlag: I love the "Goth Babe of the Week" - because you've always been that and I've known you about a thousand weeks at least. :)
rebeccablood: Well, I was that once, anyway. For a week. :)
mholzschlag: I wish I were going from success to success! 2017 saw the death of my husband, mother, full disability, loss of home and income and almost my very life! I'm teetering, but Jersey girls don't go down easy. I'm living in the Arts District in #LasVegas which is very interesting.‚ù§Ô∏è
rebeccablood: I think I knew that you were ill, but I thought you had recovered and I had no idea that you‚Äôd lost so much, and I‚Äôm so sorry to hear. xxxooo
rebeccablood: You are correct.
ElisaC: Omg, this takes me back...some conversations never die.
marypcbuk: I am woman/hear me dust
heathervescent: Making sure you amazing ladies know I threw together this survey to query interest in a Jan 25 SF meetup, a Palm Springs reunion later in the year and reconnecting our community. Please take it and share. Thanks: https://t.co/xgWlQYVDdz
alizasherman: Wow! OGWebgrrls - cool name. ;)
missrogue: Could you add the summer months as a survey? I can't do any of the other months (and I feel like summer is hot AF, but also more affordable for most!) https://t.co/MSJ1w0Xr50
heathervescent: OK, I have added summer months... I'm going to research a few venues and use my mad local negotiation skillz.
missrogue: Ask @debs @hillary @AmyLolaM about the research they did, too. They may have some contacts for you (if you don't have them already!)
heathervescent: Great idea! Will do.
carywood: Let's see, @missrogue and @heathervescent, are you seeing the tweets in which @blogdiva is talking about setting up some place over the weekend to take this conversation? She'll come back to let people know. (Trying to spread the word here.)
marypcbuk: DEMO had a conference at the ?Desert Springs? Marriot several years back; it was an excellent venue
heathervescent: Yup, will do.
alizasherman: Here's a video I made telling my origin story in tech for Women's Internet History Project: https://t.co/lkbruIwmwP - We are all media savvy women. Collectively, we can unite our voices, tell our stories, weave them together and leave more than a trace. Impact. No fear.
Tery: Love this video of you talking about the early days! It's powerful and so much to learn from your experience!
mholzschlag: Brava Aliza. And yes, so much this. I think Jen Simmons and a few others brought up the issue of Wikipedia bios and ethical means of starting to do this for one another seems a good "do" project that would have far-reaching benefits. With WaSP we had focus Task Forces. It helped!
blogdiva: 
of course, my main concern is $$$ cuz this stuff takes time &amp; effort to develop, chronicle &amp; curate.
susankitchens: I'm in. For the interviewing. But getting the money, tho‚Ä¶ that's a challenge.
carywood: Or a book. I suggested someone do a Kickstarter project, sort of near the top of the original thread. A book does double duty because it is one of the sources that Wikipedia recognizes. Then @rachelandrew said she's be willing to edit it. {or do both!}
blogdiva: yup. that's what we discussed. do turn it into a book: the "oral history" part is for the purposes of it being identified as marginal histories that haven't been told but are important to the development of what we know today as not just the web but digital &amp; social media
carywood: Great! There are so many sub-threads going at once and I'm just getting started this morning, here in PT. The more action to come out of this, the better. Wikipedia, verified Twitter accounts, a book, an oral history... that historical website being revived. What else?
blogdiva: 
LiveJournal is one of those places we never think of as "early web".
marypcbuk: I've been watching this out of general interest, but hey, I was the producer of the AOL UK tech channel 1996-2001; editorial plus *building*
coates: If it's not stepping on any toes, I may also be able to help with editing.
digitalsista: That's what's up. You started this storm. Thanks for that!
susanmernit: SO dope!
blogdiva: 
on the subject of men involved in this, amma tag @mediajunkie cuz we've talked about this in the past. he also wrote a book about the early web :)
heathervescent: So if/when we do this Palm Springs reunion, I'll bring my film crew and we can shoot interviews &amp; footage and tell these stories. :-)
blogdiva: YAS!
blogdiva: oooooh! this should be a priority.
digitalsista: Women like @jenmyronuk and others could help us with that.
heathr: That‚Äôs why I spent so much time working on teaching and making tummeling known and trying best as I could to have it credited.
zephoria: The success valued in masculine history is marked by financial profits and monetary impact while the successes of y‚Äôall are primarily marked thru community and kindness.
ElisaC: Although I'd like to think this network of community &amp; kindness fostered a million intros made to help one another get jobs, or book agents, or access to potential $$. It was Ann Winblad who connected us to our 1st investor. @Caterina gave us sage advice. and on and on.
Annaleen: It definitely did! I got several jobs through the old tech girls network
ElisaC: #fistbump
webb: Many of the most lasting and influential professional relationships ‚Äî and friendships! ‚Äî I have came about through this network.
christine: avoiding my "build structure!" bias: wondering if any #ladyOGs want to join for home dinner in SF tomorrow (Sat) night? Kid friendly (duh, Web 1.0 gen = mom aged and @calista will be there!), no agenda except storytelling/venting/inappropriate hilarity.
ElisaC: I‚Äôm still recovering from the plague. I don‚Äôt think it would be a fun outcome form the first #LadyOG meeting for me to infect everyone LOL
christine: oh @webb where are our oysters?!?!
webb: Right?  With a little champagne!  It‚Äôs been too long.
debs: This thread - Showing yet again how Twitter is still kinda broke for stuff like this - we have like 3 streams going #ladyOGs
doctorparadox: /signed. Twitter feels like a cheap toy stuffed with bots and Russians ;)
ElisaC: Agree. Facebook groups work well, but I hate giving them any more of me. Slack doesn‚Äôt do it for me. And other tools never seem to get critical mass of people using them regularly enough to keep the conversations vibrant. I‚Äôm in on Google group That‚Äôs and exception.
awsamuel: Did I ever pick a bad day to ignore Twitter! Feel like I just got home to a note reading, "hey, a whole bunch of AMAZING women had a party here while you were out." Hope to make it to SF for Jan 25 if we're really doing this! https://t.co/W6cIIG2Npz
alizasherman: Same here! Wish I could make it down from Alaska. So many incredible women from the Way Early  Days here.
christine: Jan 25?? I'm not on some branch of the thread...
heathr: Happy to move this to Signal if people like. I find it‚Äôs good for group convo
IdentityWoman: I'm NOT on Facebook. I've been actively working on the alternative infrastructure that is needed for the last 15 years. good news ladies we almost have it.... stay tuned for and event to shift who the early adopters/developers of this next layer #ladyOGs
blogdiva: ferreal... but for the time being, i'll finish the next/owcloud setup and ping you all this weekend.
mholzschlag: I want in on a formal group of some sort. It's been very inspirational just to see the energy build with people coming together in highly disrupted times and the sense of community that beats strongly. Platform is always of issue, where y'all lead, I will follow! #LadyOGs
susanmernit: Agreed! #ladyogs  #unite  #tellingourownstory
IdentityWoman: So far there has not been plans to produce She's Geeky  this year...but this thread has me thinking that She's Geeky - the LadyOG version would  be great to pull together in Q2.    Jan 25th is great for those in SF. This could be for farther out.
mholzschlag: Just for the record, January 25th is a perfect choice as it's MY birthday! :)  I will be 55 this year. Party on in my name, or come on down Vegas way!
blogdiva: i'll ping you all this weekend then. all my web work been on hold while they upgraded the server :P
mholzschlag: Sounds all too familiar to this group, no doubt :D I MISS YOU LIZA! You are a force of nature and I get all hyped up and optimistic when your energy is in the mix. It's been far too long since SXSW and events when our paths crossed. I want regular infusions of this in life again!
blogdiva: üòòüòòüòò
blogdiva: how a private nextcloud channel ? i have to finish setting on my server for brainstorming the latino history project. i can create as many private groups as i want --and it manages email lists :)
christine: fine fine lazy #LadyOGs web here you go (still adding from thread): https://t.co/KFVd3IAyso
mholzschlag: Christine i love the Lady "OGs" (Old, Got). concept. Thank you for making this list truly. I have definitely become far more #lazyWeb but this is golden!
christine: Note there are a few folks I can't add because their tweets are protected
niche: Liza and I had a Brown Bloggers Meetup. Plus we had a Women's Meetup as well back in 2004 or 2005.
blogdiva: i also created the Feminist Bloggers Network which was both an organizing group and a Blogads subnetwork... and there's some of the stuff i did with netartists (incl my exhusband) during my Rhizome years
niche: The Feminist Blogger event was held at Madame X in NYC in 2005 and it was before the first BlogHer.
heathr: I first performed MSFT=XIANS, APPL=JEWS at Top 25 Women of the Web in 1999. I think it came out of webgrrls? I had a joke about mezzanine round affirmative action for white men.
mholzschlag: and yes, Top 25 was out of Webgrrls. I remember because I was honored by them in 98 I believe, and that was my first recognition in industry. Ah, youth! ü§™
alizasherman: Webgrrls in San Francisco, was it?
mholzschlag: AAFWM? That just made me spit out my cola, Heather. :P
mholzschlag: I'm having SXSW flashbacks now to the "Blogging While Black" and "Where Are The Women" panels that some of us ran a few years there mid 2000's
awsamuel: haha yes. I was super pregnant at my first SXSW, back when it was 80% dudes, and I have never felt so conspicuously female in my whole life. It was like it was *awkward* I was having a baby. #blush
ElisaC: Oh yeah, been to many of those!
heathervescent: OMG, that was awesome. Dug up my post on the male blogger conference at Harvard back from 2005.... https://t.co/pAyo5y9XoE which got me onto Blogher's radar. Ah #blogher 1 and 2!!!!
mholzschlag: There's a slice of historical evidence alrighty! Glad that speaking up also was a bridge to opportunity for #blogher activities. What a rich history for just coming up on a quarter of a century. It's mind bloghering! üòú
ElisaC: Ha! Good one :)
ElisaC: Ahhh, indeed :)
niche: I was at both of those panels.  They were great!
mholzschlag: I remember xoxox transformational - and again, less noise to contend with. We need a refresh style event that isn't huge but embraces the world, the wide and the Web's extremely rich cultural and socially progressive potential.
blogdiva: OMG i forgot that before the ad network we had that event!!!
digitalsista: here is where my part breaks away from this particular thread. https://t.co/w2QhAaf7x1
niche: I probably have been following @huny for 8 years.
digitalsista: some of the thread is broken off. that's what happens sometimes.
digitalsista: that doesn't mean we can't add more. or someone is missing.
christine: yes, particularly as we dredge memory for folks who are pre-Web 2.0 (eg, when Web was broadcast only) and pre-2000 bubble :O
digitalsista: and those of us that survived the first bubble burst as we head to the next one.
christine: holy crap don't forget @wikiangela  - I just skimmed my blog archive and caught these names: https://t.co/gjnXCPmA2C
christine: hey @elisac @lisastone @jorydj guess when I switched https://t.co/ZrZzShrC1h from a web site to a blog? (and yes, it's past time to reinvent again...no judging please!) https://t.co/2A8rYDkzbk
JoryDJ: BlogHer 2005? That‚Äôs when we met ;)
christine: this makes me feel both happy &amp; old &amp; impressed &amp; proud - thread needs: @dianneisnor @CathyBrooks @kimpolese @DivaDanese @pahlkadot @cshipley @megnut @seriouspony and no doubt others #ladyOGs
yoz: And on the UK side: @kassschmitt @megpickard @annapickard @zoonie @spaceboy @cakemix @wonderlandblog for starters - and I've missed loads, will be kicking myself in a minute
alizasherman: are you on this thread? It is amazing and you need to be here. Miss you, my friend.
Dr_Black: Hey! I set up @bcswomen UKs first online network for women in tech in 1998, still going strong üí™ PhD on impact analysis in software finished 2001...
Dr_Black: Aliza!!! Thanks, miss you too xxxxx
missrogue: There are a few of those that are protected and won't let me add them to the list. But thank you! Added who I could!
yoz: And thank you!
yoz: Plus, all the women who worked on the standards and infrastructure the web depends on. Look at this pic from 1995! https://t.co/GlUbwHZb5P (I see @Des in the front row)
yoz: DOH, Sorry, misread - IETF 95 is obviously not 1995. But @Des was definitely involved in the early days.
Annaleen: This reminds me that @wseltzer should be on this thread
ElisaC: Speaking of lawyers... @laurengelman and Denise Howell too.
coates: I noticed @dhowell participating in this thread, already (-:
ElisaC: Gah, thanks, forgot her handle :)
missrogue: 
Here is where the list is at right now: https://t.co/25hYYDk0iR
dhowell: Amazing list!
heathr: @emilyd
missrogue: Done!
ElisaC: Oops, I tagged some other Meg Hourihan earlier! Also not on Twitter that I could find was Chris Nolan.
debs: Love it -and yes "the list is life" gonna try to think of more dromedary NYC wwwac days
heathervescent: That reminds me of @susiewyshak 's SuperViva life list site. She's OG too.
Annaleen: Yep we are all still here, despite the fact that we remember the 20th century
missrogue: Omg everyone. I ‚ù§Ô∏è you all! Miss you all so much!!! üòç how about a reunion somewhere tropical üê† üèù? ;)
kanter: This has been the best thing yet in 2018 to reconnect with all you awesome women
estherschindler: HECK YEAH
mholzschlag: It is very nice to see many names I miss and adore! The noise has gotten noisy, hasn't it? But clearly our passions and work are still very much alive and well which is cause for celebration indeed! xo
ElisaC: Agree üòª
Fritinancy: + Ellen Ullman, "Life in Code" et al. (Don't think she's on Twitter.) https://t.co/uwXXs4QEqP
marypcbuk: Has anyone tagged Jane Margolis for Unlocking the Clubhouse (2002 write up of earlier research )
debs: Great - idea!
susanmernit: Wishing we could do a meet up in February..i might have a space for 30.. Jan is a no go for me
heathr: 
I have patron-backed comps for anyone who‚Äôd need one.
kanter: Miss you too - and a reunion sounds great
susanmernit: Omg!!! Did not see this storm till late last night! Love it.
blogdiva: OHAI SUSAN!!!
digitalsista: https://t.co/ek7n6QJkBG
doctorparadox: hells to the yes: I'm in! üçπüå¥üçπüòé
susanmernit: February???
blogdiva: omg... am down with that!!!
ElisaC: Mmm I like that!!!
heathervescent: Actually I have been thinking about having/organizing/producing a women's conference in Palm Springs. ;-) ;-) ;-) (but not during the summer).
missrogue: And hey, since #YxYY is taking a break, the @acehotel PS may be looking for a group! ;)
ElisaC: I have never been there and have been saying lately I want to go!
missrogue: Omg, you‚Äôll LOVE the mid-century modern architecture. It‚Äôs to DIE for.
ElisaC: So I‚Äôve heard!
heathervescent: Also, I basically live here now (well 45 min away) so easy 2 research!
blogdiva: ok... am excited... THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN!!!
missrogue: I‚Äôm down with helping make it so.
heathervescent: OK, I have some ideas. Will come back on twitter in a few hours with them. :-)
missrogue: Good call, though we braved Palm Springs the past few July‚Äôs for #yxyy, which was crazy hot, but fun AF (and inexpensive as far as PS goes!)
digitalsista: But some of us are not. We've lost a few!
ElisaC: When you put it like that‚Ä¶yeesh!
Annaleen: It just means that we are awesome
blogdiva: indeed we are :)
heathr: 
If a yes, DM your  *committed* RSVP. Don‚Äôt make me eat a whole cake at the bar myself.
kanter: This sound wonderful
lizhenry: Yes to cake aw yeah
Annaleen: sadly I'm in Canada on that day. but hope to see you ladies at some other rendezvous soon!
heathervescent: I am in SF Jan 23-25thish... Could I selfishly suggest SF one of those evenings? Pretty pretty please? I miss all you amazing ladies.
Annaleen: I could do the 25th!
heathervescent: I will wrangle/organize a meetup on the evening of the 25th in San Francisco... Details forthcoming... does ~7pm work? Or could do earlier ~4 or 5....
ElisaC: Earlier is probably better for those of us coming from Outside the city, but depends on everyone‚Äôs Flexibility.
charleneli: Happy to host at my house in Alamo Square. Or meet downtown if easier. Blocked out my calendar!!
ElisaC: Charlene!!! (Downtown is never easier in my experience LOL)
christine: Ah found the thread...and boo! I'm traveling that date. :(
ElisaC: Boo!
heathervescent: That sounds lovely! Thanks for the offer @charleneli - you sure you cool with it? How about a ~3pm potluckish tea?
heathervescent: Do we have day jobs anymore? (I don't.) Would 3pm afternoon tea or something be better?
ElisaC: Traditional day job? Nope, me either. Id be coming from San Jose, so an outlier for sure. Earlier is better for me.
kanter: Ditto for those us down south
niche: @digitalsista
blogdiva: OMG your crew from the cupcake blog needs to be in this list!!! y'all started that trend!
heathr: Hello old friends.
debs: what comes to mind "The list is life" ;)
digitalsista: I was tagged as part of this thread by @BAoki with connections to @huny I have a separate thread based on Huny's comments. So let me add @nmsanchez and then give my connection to the history in that time.
nmsanchez: Thanks, friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è
digitalsista: Also I don't see @lynneluvah Who was a key player during that timeline as well. I'm sure she can add more women of color that I may have missed.
debs: more OG: @amylola @WilloLovesYou @hillary  - @YxYY
lynneluvah: Thanks for the mention
ElisaC: I think @missrogue tagged the wrong @lynnjohnson (instead of @lynneluvah) although Lynn is also awesome :) I should go dig up the list of advisory board members/speakers/attendees at the first BlogHer. #treasuretrove
lynneluvah: Thanks for the mention
blogdiva: ohai love!!!
digitalsista: Anita Brown is no longer with us and I miss her a bunch. She started Black Geeks online. History in tech doesn't continue to repeat her name but hey thanks to Google books some of you can catch up. https://t.co/yhsJdAWMys p. 39
mholzschlag: Anita passed? OMG I didn't know, lost in the fray of other losses and tragedies of our past years. She was an inspiration and I'm sad to hear this. Where are the women indeed. :(
digitalsista: Yes, quite some time ago. I was fortunate to attend her funeral but there wasn't much national attention on the pain or the loss of her input in our story.
mholzschlag: I'm truly bereft to find this out. I wish I had known. I was in my own hell. It's no excuse. In fact, it's the heart of the problem. We have no true Commons of Equity in the world much less industry.
blogdiva: i have to tag @mamitamala in this convo. we've been informally talking about creating a kind of "Latino History of the Web" and for years i've said there's a huge need for an oral history of the indie (aka non-corporate) web/social media.
alizasherman: Love that!!
mamitamala: Oh God/was yes. I'm interested in a woc/history of the web but also looking at some of the politics behind it
digitalsista: This article came out in 1997. I had already started the first WoC web firm. Two years later I would form Digital Sisters/as the very first organization to get women and girls of color online and in tech.
digitalsista: This conversation about diversity in tech has a lot people talking now but from my view the fact that we are having this conversation right now means we haven't gone that far in understanding tech history.
digitalsista: And let me add I'm one of the few if the not the only that has my story connected to both Black Geeks Online and WebGrrls community.
alizasherman: Yes!!
mholzschlag: I hate to polish the obvious, but we haven't got that far in understanding history much less telling the truth about it. :x
digitalsista: we are definitely not telling the truth and there are folks re "rock stars" that stole from those that don't get named or able to defend themselves.
sheilaellen: Sorry for the misattribution...
RicardoHarvin: She was probably the second web name I learned, after Tim.
sheilaellen: Co-founder of the UK's EFF (@OpenRightsGroup), social media expert and blogger, @Suw and @barefoot_techie, who led ORG after Sue.
Suw: Thanks for the mention!! Also Stephanie Booth, @stephtara.
EvaPascoe: Thx for mention, I co-founded Cyberia Cafe, world's first Internet Cafe in 1994, then set up first ecom fashion Websites for @Topshop üòé
clevrcat: This thread. I‚Äôm learning projects and people I‚Äôve never been exposed to, being just young enough to miss out. Thank you.
plasticmind: Sorry, that should have been @elisebauer
elisebauer: I was active, but not influential until 2003. Heidi Swanson started @101Cookbooks in 2002. There's Meg Hourihan, founder of Blogger. Ask @Peterme he would know.
peterme: Speaking of Heidi and @101Cookbooks, has anyone mentioned Minda Sandler, former editor (in chief?) of The Net magazine, the premier publication about building internet things from the mid-90s.
peterme: Also, Misty West and Crystal Waters for their role in programming the Web 97-98-99 conferences.
elisebauer: Oh, and how could I forget Lynda Weinman of https://t.co/0gC279NmlZ! She practically taught the world how to do web design way back when. Sold her company for a billion dollars to LinkedIn a few years ago.
briscreative: @Nitrozac
jstweedie: I love the thread. Wld note tho, again, basically, women being asked to help a guy out w. a 'pet' (&amp; all its connotations) project. Do think the list matters tho - imp. reminder of how fast we get erased from public memory.
estherschindler: If nothing else it's the best #FF thread I've seen in years. :-)
coates: Hi. Despite my clumsy question, I hope this helps clear up my intent: https://t.co/SxW5ApOXuK
jstweedie: Appreciate that - had read that second pot. But I also think the point I made needed to be made - even if I was stepping into a convo while eavesdropping. Cheers.
coates: Cheers. I hope it's still acceptable to ask these kids of questions and have these kinds of conversations. I think it's important to learn about history that was unknown or forgotten. Really happy so many women responded, honestly.
jstweedie: Not an acceptability issue, as much as a framing/signalling issue I was drawing attn to; as well as who was actually doing the work that will make up the answer...
sheilaellen: From the structured text world: @JeniT, @btusdin, @dalapeyre, @laurendw, @xmlgrrl, @walmsleyph, @harveybetty
sheilaellen: Plus, Sharon Adler (https://t.co/E7TygxVWAd), Joan Smith (https://t.co/uobfrPg3R6), Lynne A. Price (https://t.co/5NxlKtf2cX) and more. The SGML world included many women whose work directly and indirectly impacted the web, then and now.
benjaminkrein: If it hasn‚Äôt been mentioned yet maybe you would like checking out @NetHistoryPod for some ideas &amp; great interviews from exactly this era.
chrisdymond: Esther Dyson (@edyson) - wrote Release 2.0 in 1997 I think?
despens: I recommend checking out the female artists from Rhizome's Net Art Anthology found at https://t.co/d5gw6DDBwT
TheKateFreeman: Elizabeth Castro &amp; Laura Lemay taught people how with their books.
misterprotocol: Well, Elizabeth Zwicky literally wrote the book on computer security.  Laura Breeden was head of user services at CSNET, the first ISP.  Charlotte Mooers was head of documentation at CSNET.
carywood: We'd be remiss not to mention @kissane, who, among other things, started at @alistapart in 1999. That's a few years within the article timeframe for playing a major part in a very influential voice on the web. Some mighty important articles!
suldrew: Immediately @anamariecox and @hhavrilesky come to mind
anamariecox: @joanwalsh!
heybonanos: too
joanwalsh: and Laura Miller, a Salon founder, @magiciansbook
hhavrilesky: @magiciansbook
hollyjallen: led the development of Flash.
ultrasaurus: late reply to this....  In '95 I was on the original Shockwave team. Flash was created by Jonathan Gay, and I joined him in 2000 (or late 1999?) to lead the development of Flash video. Also @LisaGelobter worked on Shockwave and later launched Hulu....  so many more #ladyOGs
LisaGelobter: And @Heidivt73 who worked on Dreamweaver...
kecatlin: Plus @WWLoriHC
martineworkman: I don't know if anyone has mentioned this project: pocket pig. I don't remember the name of the woman, but she'd sketch her meals on a device and post them. First time I saw what would become a food blog. I loved it. Late 90s/early 2000s I think?
Sheila_Regan: Anna Voog.
mediajunkie: !!
webinista: Um. Thanks.
bluesmoon: kasia trapszo (https://t.co/C4rFEKoaJl) and @DivaDanese come to mind.
mediajunkie: initially out of the Bad Subjects zine at Berkeley
daryll: My ex, Suzanne Woolf, worked for ICANN during those years
TheEricLawrence: Esther Dyson
BAoki: First tech job: web producer for https://t.co/hRO6vUkAdz in 1995 (Before many in SF had a home page University of Washington had webcam!) Founded Seattle‚Äôs Webgrrls &amp;Linuxchix chapters. Thousands in my cohort... @lisa_dawson @denisejacobs Caryn Rose, others!
denisejacobs: 
@coates, you also need to add Jennifer Niederst Robbins or @lynnedjohnson to the list. Also @webinista, @vlh, @sniffles off of the top of my head.
BAoki: Give @alizasherman the props - we would never have had  3,000 Webgrrls in Seattle doing workshops/recruited for jobs before 2000 if she hadn‚Äôt kicked me in butt to start it.
wendyck: Kim Polese built Marimba, which was push technology before we had push notifications. Esther Dyson (@edyson) was hugely influential in the late 1990s.
designbyrobots: Colleen Bushell.. ux on NCSA mosaic project
RichAsInRichard: is one I think you might consider.
vpieters: Thanks for thinking of me Rich. Much appreciated!
RichAsInRichard: It was folks like you and @colly who showed me (way back when) that a) blogs - and the web in general - could be beautiful and b) blogging was ‚Äúfree education‚Äù - a great influence on my life and what/who I am now. Thank *you* :)
caseyrosenthal: can't forget @eveandersson
industrial_book: and her legendary Pi page, now at Google.
MicheleMarut: loving the lists but why those years in particular?
coates: Personally important to me. Early web development, pre-web-2.0.
idiot_girl: So basically you didn‚Äôt recognize any women as influential when you were in your early years?
b2ornotb2: i really hope this isnt serious... typical misguided feminism
idiot_girl: Lol ok
coates: Of course not. Even though my original question was clumsily worded, the intent was actually to learn about women I *didn't* know about, and to fill in the gaps in memory. https://t.co/SxW5ApxmDc
carywood: I'm so happy you started this conversation, Sean! Not only will there be an article about influential women from those days, which will be fascinating, but we (women web-makers) really have some action points based on the fabulous comments.
coates: Thank you. (-:
idiot_girl: Well I suppose it‚Äôs too late to actually validate that statement so we will have to take your word for it.
PaulLomax: Just Web tech? Or business? If the latter then @Marthalanefox. https://t.co/m2Sw2Xe4d0
amyhoy: sure influenced the PHP world.
snipeyhead: Did I? I just threw up some shitty blog posts
amyhoy: i was in #php and watched you influence people all day long every damn day!
snipeyhead: Wow, I had no idea. (I really mean that.)
amyhoy: who started gURL ? lost to the sands of time it appears, and rather ungoogleable
amyhoy: looks like nobody got mena trott aka @dollarshort
coates: Lots of her (-:
amyhoy: did they? i scrolled so hard, sean. didn‚Äôt see any mentions. I SCROLLED SO HARD üòÇ
carywood: This is crazy! I was just coming here to type in her name!!
amyhoy: GMTA :D
steveax: I think @laura_carlson and the Web Design Update newsletter should get a nod.
ChrisCavallucci: This thread is awesome. Don‚Äôt forget @MegWhitman for eBay and @bobulate for great #writing
csiTO: Absolutely our Founder and CEO @tonyasurman. I'm sure she has other names to add to the list, too.
allaboutgeorge: I'd point to @huny
awoods: 
Gina Trapani @ginatrapani created LifeHacker in 2005.
johnsandercock: Esther Schindler, and the woman who started the Web Style Guide, and Jessica Valenti, and Ann Althouse.
cwodtke: see also https://t.co/MrDBLnGrZS
cydharrell: here's the 1999 Top 25 Women on the Web awards, which I helped host as a member of the steering crew of SF Women on the Web https://t.co/JkHlre2gZw
cwodtke: see also https://t.co/l9CsUbpVg2
ramsey: Add @dollarshort to the list. I believe the first release of Movable Type was in 2001.
LeannePrain: Also Bust Magazine was building the Girl Wide Web, my first person email was a woman-centred email platform called Chickmail. There are a ton of women in design curation &amp; VR who started in code
mediajunkie: yes, yes... also Bitch magazie folks, and the quirky alone person?
knitgrrl: What about Leah (who founded @craftster), @rebeccablood, @halley ...I remember meeting @espiers at Bloggercon (and Biz Stone too, for that matter...)
laurenbacon: A few other folks that come to mind: Heather Champ (can‚Äôt find her on Twitter but she‚Äôs @haitchchamp on Insta), @Loobylu, @alizasherman, @hanneblank, @skeskali, &amp;  @101Cookbooks (cofounder of ChickClick). Also @meomiCloud!
skeskali: When I look at this list and think back and look at where I am now...things have really changed.
emiramears: Oh I could add a whole bunch to this list as well. @caterina @heathercorinna @yougrowgirl @audrawilliams @carlymilne @mightygirl @emmapayne @notmartha quickly come to mind but there were so many more. (also all hail chickmail, those were the days).
LeannePrain: Great list - I think I visited Gayla‚Äôs Superfantastico website 100‚Äôs of times when I was looking for exciting examples of web design @yougrowgirl and @damedarcy‚Äôs early multimedia site.
yougrowgirl: Thanks so much! Was probably our main Fluffco site. SuperFantastico was our store. Nice to meet you. Loved your book Strange Material!
LeannePrain: It was Fluffco! I love all your sites - and your books too. Still have them.
yougrowgirl: Lots of great names in this thread. Also @TaraAriano and @TomatoNation who ran Television Without Pity way back when.
audrawilliams: Oh man being on this list of people makes me feel like my heart is going to burst. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
DonoYEG: Love you Audra. You more than earned a place on this list.
emiramears: If you have the time read the whole thread. It‚Äôs beautiful, inspiring and (for me) a bit sad. Those were different days.
photo_obscura: brought a lot of people together back then
heywren: 
Heather Champ, original owner of Jezebel dot com and creator of The Mirror Project, among other cool web things.
michaelbierut: Lisa @strausfeld, @MIT @medialab and Quokka Sports

MikeWas: Leslie Harpold.
BellinghamToday: Lynda Weinman is obvious one
twithoff: Judy brewer at W3C WAI
cybertext: Laura Lemay wrote several books on HTML
jessamyn: Leslie Harpold. Rebecca Blood (@rebeccablood). @mightygirl @zannah Most others have been mentioned multiple times. Me and MetaFilter doing community stuff.
alexismallen: Thank you for adding Leslie to this list, Jessamyn.  She inspired and mentored so many. I wish she were here.
carywood: omg I'm so glad you thought of her. I was wracking my brain trying to think of her name.
jessamyn: I never got to interact with her personally (I don't think) but me and @MetaGrrrl worked a lot on her Wikipedia page. She did so much good work, touched so many lives.
lisagrimm: Can also give you the names of my https://t.co/vuvzVWHvKL co-workers; I was there from '98-'01, but have friends there earlier (I was busy building early sites for Time Out, Debenhams, Christies and more before that).
hanhaiwen: There‚Äôs quite a few here: https://t.co/T21N0uvreH
TinaHolmboe: I'd like to add Donna Smillie, of RNIB fame, mind, who did great work on accessibility. Quite a few lovely ladies at that org, truth be told.
mattmay: Just from the #a11y side: @wendyabc is behind the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the mid 90s. Judy Brewer's run W3C/WAI since '97. Also, off the top: @sharrush @goodwitch @shawn_slh @cyns @lorettaguarino @Ryladog @egyrs were doing the work before I arrived in 2000.
egyrs: We are legion :-) thanks @mattmay for remember us.
wendyabc: Plus @annbass @becka11y and Andi Snow-Weaver
annbass: Ohmigosh, you guys (@mattmay, @wendyabc, Judy Brewer, and many others) are the stars who‚Äôve been slogging in the trenches since the beginning of Web time! I am supportive, but not worthy of mention among you luminaries. (I‚Äôm honored tho.)
mattmay: Well-deserved.
TinaHolmboe: Suspect I'm not on the list - doubt anyone WANT to recall the WDG and the XHTML 2 WG ..... :)
simonstl: This is a great conversation!  I'd add Ann Navarro, of webgeek and various W3C projects, and Sally Khudairi @HALOWorldwide and Janet Daly @janetweets for their work making the W3C visible.
janetweets: Hi, Sean. My W3C tour of duty was '99-'08. lmk how I can help.
janetweets: Right off the bat, I'd point to SallyK (w3c from 96?-98, pr is an understatement for her work), Eve Maler (XML), Lauren Wood (xml, dom). Deirdre Mulligan (Policy/P3P, now Berkeley Law Prof), Judy Brewer and Wendy Chisholm (accessibility)
simonstl: That's a great list! In the XML (and W3C TAG) zone, I'd also add Jeni Tennison.
janetweets: +1  I think for Sean's timeframe, she was a superstar in the XSL/XSLT area too. Molly Holzchlag @mholzschlag is a must for that list too.
janetweets: Good grief, all the "too"s. Apologies.
janetweets: + Mary Ellen Zurko, Security. I'd look at ed/auth lists on specs from that time. Lots of phenomenal work often done without fanfare.
janetweets: reading this list, I'm reminded of how, in spite of connectedness, so many different communities were already well underway by '99. I had completed 3 web gigs myself, incl 2 startups + serving as part of MIT Webmaster team (https://t.co/Phsahe7cpO) Par for the course.
janetweets: .. in that we were all getting in there and doing our thing(s). Thanks for starting this thread.
jukevox: @soledadobrien
chetmurthy: Ana Marie Cox (https://t.co/UBU1BnNIfi)
themodernageorg: obviously
nickiehills: I don‚Äôt think there was a time when @DameWendyDBE wasn‚Äôt influential in the internet since she was key to it creation!
DameWendyDBE: There is a book coming out soon about the impact of female pioneers  on the Internet. I was interviewed by the author for it. I‚Äôll find out when it‚Äôs due out
bl4nk: and many more https://t.co/xUSoRpq9Io pioneers
jenbee: This thread is giving me so many feels! I remember eating burritos in South Park w/ Drue Miller + @Caterina on the very day I arrived in SF, back in 1996. Would also add @lwaldal + @abbedon to your list, along with many peeps mentioned already.
abbedon: Thanks for the mention @jenbee. Those were some amazing times.
lwaldal: And treatment of women in tech hasn't improved much since then üò°
jenbee: I would go as far as to argue that it's calcified into something much uglier. I have too many friends who've had to do things like hire security to protect themselves and their families.
janelleb: Oh wow, and here's a trove for you: 1998's "Top 25 Women on the Web" awards, which included names like Denise Caruso, Brenda Laurel, Kim Polese, Laura LeMay, Janese Swanson, Stacy Horn ... and myself ;) https://t.co/Y45Z338X0O
jenbee: Also: @alainabrowne, @janemount, @ariannaorland, @petahoyes + @lemay!

gabemastey: wrote a book that was a big influence on me: https://t.co/yHFbcnQ67m
smoochbelly: In a less direct way, Lynda of https://t.co/g7w6HOX3gE. Tutorials for web designers and artists. Pioneer of video learning. https://t.co/rCpd1084aZ
michaelj: For me, @MaggyTheBrave and @alexismallen come to mind. Both extremely influential in the personal web before blogs.
jjeffries1: How about @mholzschlag?
prosediva: - Heather Hesketh of hesketh dot com.
hesketh: Thank you for the shout out :-)
prosediva: --cofounder of Pyra Labs, the company that launched the Blogger personal blogging software that was acquired by Google. She published weblogs at Megnut dot com and meg.hourihan dot com.
maximolly: There were a lot of women on the web. Use the Wayback Machine &amp; look at Sxsw interactive and Web98, Web99‚Ä¶I‚Äôd add people like @clevergirl (managing editor at Netscape in 1996) or Alma Derricks (launched https://t.co/1nAywMR88u)
clevergirl: Thanks @maximolly!
dylan_hardison: 
https://t.co/L4IVezXGBW
anatsuno: Oh wait, you sais up to 2002 and both those came after. Wow I feel old.

xtraslky: @lisago_van
mikkipedia: Marisa Bowe, Ana Marie Cox, Stacy Burns, Esther Drill, @rebeccaodes

stevenbjohnson: Definitely include @stefaniesyman who founded FEED with me in early 1995 and was a major presence in the early NYC web scene.
ericpromislow: Patti Maes, creator of Firefly at MIT, among other things https://t.co/tVcXCMXWuD
epc: Carol Moore, ran web at IBM 1994-2000.
GriffinClubMerv: The late Jeanette Symons, who founded Industrious Kids after being an early pioneer in the telecommunications industry.
briannaorg: Tons. @alexismallen and @MaggyTheBrave are the reasons I learned PHP and ran a hosting co, @maximolly @auriea @zannah all inspired me to approach the web academically and artistically.
MaggyTheBrave: Thanks for the mention! I began my journal and various web and hypertext experiments in December 1994, if it helps. I was also involved professionally, I ran the web NOC and hosting operations for an early ISP, launched my own shop in 1997.
MaggyTheBrave: I'm curious about your project. I worry sometimes that these lists of *women* don't do much to change the perception about our absence in tech. As you can see, there's no shortage of names, but these projects sometimes come off as niche and are forgotten.
coates: I was compiling a list of people I remembered influencing from that era and noticed that it was mostly men, and thought "I'm sure there are women who should be on this list" so I asked. Hope that's taken as inclusive and beneficial.
MaggyTheBrave: Ah! That, I think, is definitely beneficial, thank you :)
alexismallen: Hi! All my memories are riddled with women. But the Internet has always been countless unique circles of influence &amp; friendship. Maybe it was always personal, providing by self-selection exactly what you were seeking (whether you knew it or not). That‚Äôs a lovely idea, isn‚Äôt it?
MaggyTheBrave: It is, but it's also cautionary. All our memories were formed by younger, less wise versions of ourselves. Our interests and "common sense" of the era is evident in what we actually remember now, and in the gaps in that memory.
MaggyTheBrave: Instead, what I think we could use is better representation in general histories of the Internet and the web, where I think we are woefully under represented, and keep having to fight for citations.
crazybutable: Laura Lemay @lemay
josephholmes: for sure
AKMA: Dorothea Salo (not on Twitter)  @mamamusings @jeneane @Halley and I must be missing others whom I'll curse myself for forgetting
shifted: Thanks for the shoutout, @AKMA. I saw her linked to but want to make sure to call out @jessamyn, and I'd add @kgs and Marylaine Block, both of whom were early curators of the web and helped demonstrate the potential
kgs: In LibraryLand there's also Carol Leita, founder of the Librarians' Index to the Internet, and Jean Armour Polly, author of "Surfing the Internet." Beyond, of course you have Esther Dyson not to mention @estherschindler who can provide a slew of names.
lisalibrarian: K ... there is Ann &lt;can't think of last name ... deceased .. I know you know her ... Michigan?&gt;
lisalibrarian: Berkeley not MI. Anne Lipow! https://t.co/k7JNVDRsJ0
jessamyn: Marylaine Block, agreed! She had an early library "e-zine" that was one of the first in librarianship. She passed in... (some date I can't tell because of @amlibraries archives!) https://t.co/K7q9NWvUty Highly formative in librarian blogging. https://t.co/v4NU6rCo5J
amlibraries: September 2014. (We are aware that the Currents/People archives are confusing. It's on the list of things to fix!)
ResearchBuzz: Marylaine is missed!
estherschindler: 
Also @agunn wants to be part of the conversation.
lynngr: And you should be added, Esther!
estherschindler: I was just noisy. Not particularly influential.
kgs: no no no no no. You were influential!
estherschindler: Thanks, sweetie, but how? Other than by making the world appreciate chocolate a little more.
agunn: Didn't you co-found the Internet Press Guild? :-)
estherschindler: 
Which is funny considering how often I exhort women to toot their own horns.
sjvn: I seem to recall that you were one of the founders too Angela!
agunn: That may have happened. So did the Mosaic book with the HTML training (in '94). But publishing itself -- does it count? Books only? Magazines? And considering how it all worked out for publishing jobs, does that writing about the early Net was a self-inflicted wound? ü§î
kgs: A lot of those early books were super-important. Thinking of Anne Lipow publishing @rtennant's Crossing the Internet Threshold.
agunn: Oooh. All right, if I survive this deadline I am totally going through my back issues. There are a LOT of foremothers to consider. (Wouldn't it be lovely if this thread led to a whole lot of Wikipedia entries?)
estherschindler: Yessssssssss
agunn: *does that mean
agunn: Definitely Heather Champ, who started with Cool SotD and did so much beyond it. Margaret Wertheim's historical perspective was amazing. Perry Aftab and Glee Harrah Cady were miles ahead on data privacy. Robin Raskin for running PC Mag's front of book. I...
agunn: ...can doubtless come up with many more off-deadline; those are precisely Yahoo Internet Life's years and I have the whole print run at hand.
kellentperry: https://t.co/oa3mR4cHDE

zoonini: Looks like you've gotten tons more names overnight, yay. Curious to know more about your project, too. :) Greetings from a fellow Montrealer.
Arlen: and @rachelandrew were the first names I thought of in this context, but I see others beat me to suggesting them. Truly, if you can‚Äôt come up with a half-dozen or more in less than 30 seconds, you‚Äôve not paid attention.

preinheimer: 
The better ones move their content to /&lt;year&gt;/, but they seem rare.
lxt: goes back to 2001 online at least (my first conference talks!)  Academic conferences also live forever and WWW is a good source there
lxt: and @mholzschlag and of course @SaraMG  also spring to mind
gatovato: Laura Lemay. Author of some of the first books on html development. If you expand to the internet as a whole then kc claffy.
emelaarghh: In Australia Liddy Nevile (especially via @OZeWAI) and @deyalexander were tireless advocates of web accessibility, particularly in the public sector.

Tery: Thanks so much Aliza! @coates more than happy provide a list of women influential in Web from 1995-2002. Aliza among those still involved. Lets connect!
emelaarghh: and @clevergirl were among the early stars of UX who in 2001 formed the https://t.co/dvgxK21I5w consultancy. And @KaraAnn researched and co-authored so many of the Nielsen Norman Group's most useful reports &amp; guidelines.

obiwankimberly: I'd add myself to the growing list, since no one has mentioned me! I'll also add Sarah Horton (Web Style Guide), Kelly Goto (Web Redesign 2.0), and Lynda Weinman (https://t.co/q7BLKrzIo3) as I didn't see them mentioned yet.
obiwankimberly: Oops, I nearly forgot to mention Ann Dixon who worked on @bmcserendip at @BrynMawrCollege
obiwankimberly: Also, I need to mention my friends/coworkers/idols: @susiewyshak who was one of the first tech evangelists I ever met, and @femmebot and @milissa who were major contributors to UX and design direction at AOL.
obiwankimberly: Going back a bit before 1995, please don't forget Nicola Pellow (who wrote the LMB). And I'd like to call out @fantasai who later joined the CSS WG and has been very influential.
davidjohngrady: Lisa Allen ran Boston Sidewalk (Microsoft city guide), AT&amp;T Business Network (https://t.co/v6XJX0CLyq) and other early online content plays in the Boston area. A fine boss, too!
davidjohngrady: Well, not that biznet. https://t.co/m0JZycqhFi
fladamd: I don't think cloud computing would be where it is today without Evi Nemeth. @radiaperlman invented the spanning tree protocol that made large networks possible and apparently understood twitter better than any of us 9 years ago.
mrazzari: Hard to think of a woman more influential than @cwodtke in the early 2000s. Also the work she's doing now, highlighting women.
ElizabethN: I'd add Anita Borg, Deb Richardson, Roberta Williams (co-founder of Sierra Online) and Jan Brandt from AOL (the one behind all those free discs :D ).
wendywoowho: Out of curiosity, what's the project, and what sources have been failing you so far?
cwodtke: when I was active an influential then üòú my heroes included Ginny Redish, Brenda Laurel, JoAnne Hackos, Karen Holtzblatt, Carolyn Synder, Julie Stanford, Amy Jo Kim.... just off the top of my head....
pascalchevrel: Molly Holzschlag @mholzschlag
andyw4: Uk - Eva Pascoe
fontnerd: This hasn't been updated in a while but: https://t.co/tgskkcAcFN
cnorthwood: Martha Lane Fox?
meyerweb: To the other names people have raised, I‚Äôll add Sue Sims (CSS Samurai), @lemay, @xeni, and @heathr.  And @Lynda.
heathr: 
2/2
heathr: 
1/2
knitgrrl: I was just going to say @thriftyknitter ‚Äî long before I knew her in person I knew her website!
heathr: I loved that web site. And https://t.co/0JeulkrIMv And https://t.co/wdOSkjY8Vx And @judith‚Äôs 20 things and so much more.
janelleb: thanks Heather! Sean, I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I can list tons of early female webzine pioneers, tech journalists and influential online media types.
janelleb: ... for example: Aliza Sherman of Cybergrrl,  Heidi Swanson, founder of Chickclick; Rebecca Odes and Esther Drill - founders of https://t.co/iQINJneWiz; tech journalists Katharine Mieszkowski and Katie Hafner,
PerfectPlum: Teams of digital pioneers at late 90s 'girl power' sites, like Girl Games and Purple Moon, including myself, @janbozarth, @blaurel...
janelleb: Purple Moon was the best.
kevlaw: made Java happen.
AaronMendezNYC: Does your list include Auriea Harvey (@auriea)? Anyone who remembers her 1990s-era Entropy8 site may agree that her explorations of the web as an artistic medium are arguably still unequalled. She did some quite high-profile commercial web work at the time too.
laurenbacon: +1 to this! Entropy8 was brilliant.
briannaorg: does amazing VR work and posts beautiful works in progress on IG
jabley: was a big influence (and still is!)
WWLoriHC: Heather Champ, Min-Jung Kim, @dori, @stefsull, @megnut... so many women in the early days.
sevapetrov: Sysadmins, DBAs and some backend devs will surely recognize @aefrisch. Her Essential System Administration is the UNIX admin's bible.
lizhenry: Yes! That was the best.
hselftax: 
I was chair of my professional body‚Äôs technical committee from 1999 to 2001 and signed off all technical releases; should have a reasonable online profile for that period.
konnidee: Ginny Redish #UX https://t.co/v7bpuePGE9
morganmquinn: comes to mind
giveupalready: possibly @SaraMG was doing cool things in that time period
SaraMG: 
I did invent Twitter during this period though. (I called it: https://t.co/tWtmqXzKHl, but it worked the same basic way)
coates: I wondered when that was. (-:
metaprinter: created Flickr https://t.co/pWN1tTSqGp
coates: Yep. Flickr is 2004 according to Wikipedia. Looking for pre-web-2.0 stuff mostly. Thanks, though.
heathervescent: I remember Flickr being launched (or was just launched) at this event in Hawaii run by Moses Ma...
janelleb: was active and influential in the Web world way before Flickr, from the very early days on.
metaprinter: Yeah I regret mentioning it in my tweet. She‚Äôs a goddamn pioneer and PHP guru regardless of Flickr.
idiot_girl: ^ thank you! It‚Äôs not like she just sprang up as a fully formed PHP Guru is 2004!
swissmiss: What about these ladies: @vpieters, @aworkinglibrary, @brainpicker, @jodify, @Caterina
jodify: 
Sean, hi! I'd add Kathy Sierra (formerly @ SeriousPony) and @cydharrell to this great list.
vpieters: Thanks so much Tina! üòò
Brian_Ronald: 
https://t.co/KyGeLUwvUT
erietta: So many practitioners, and community leaders (meet ups, email lists, conferences, newsletters). In Australia I‚Äôd start with @russmaxdesign who ran the Web Standards Group community. I discovered it, learned heaps, and fell in love with the industry
willf: Do you have @megnut yet?
goldie_: Dani Horowitz founded DaniWeb in early 2000s I think @DaniWeb
mintsauce: Xeni Jardin. A key figure behind boingboing - https://t.co/439LiOaPnF
nickf: There is no way this List could be complete without @mholzschlag @dori @go2girl @cwodtke @whitneyq @danachis @kimgoodwin @swissmiss @lauraklein @msweeny &amp; many many more women.
danachis: Erin Malone
stefsull: Remember Liz with the purple hair? I can't think of her last name...
nickf: YES! @emalone!!
heathervescent: LOVE Erin! We worked together. I remember when she launched Boxes and Knobs! Nostalgia!
danachis: Thank you ‚Äî couldn‚Äôt come up with her twitter handle
nickf: It‚Äôs all good. Love this thread, it‚Äôs full of folks I have great respect for and many folks I‚Äôve failed to keep in touch with but seeing their names again drives many fond memories.
tobmaster: 
And a cool person when you meet her
em606: What do you count as 'influential'? There were lots of us starting out our careers, pioneering techniques that are now standard...
Morendil: Lisa Rein
onion2k: Jennifer Ringley who was the inventor of lifecasting with her "JenniCam" project. She was getting millions of visitors a week *in 1996*. Just about as pioneering as it gets. :)
coates: This is perfect. I meant to include her on my list, in early brainstorming, but forgot when I got to the keyboard. Thanks!
musingvirtual: should maybe make this list in her own right but more importantly wrote a lot about the JenniCam and other early camgirl projects.
maco_nix: Lyssa of Lyssa Explains? There's an entire generation of web devs who first learned from her.
KimGoransson: Does it have to be internationally known stars? Either way, Annica Tiger was a Swedish pioneer who made HTML knowledge available for the broader Swedish public during the late 90s, early 00's. Almost every Swedish dev, male or female, knows who she is.
hilarymarsh: @maximolly
maximolly: Sean: we ran Maxi (a feminist webzine) &amp; a network of women‚Äôs sites, and there were a lot of webzines then by women. Some more folks: @janelleb @Caterina @megnut @101Cookbooks (heidi swanson) @bust_magazine, @BitchMedia &amp; many others. Ping me for details
janelleb: This thread is making me nostalgic.
maximolly: Me too.
jenbee: Right?! Sigh.
janelleb: Also, just finished binge-watching Season 4 of (the excellent!) Halt &amp; Catch Fire -- it could have been based on my life back in 1995, reviewing, one-by-one, all the web sites in existence for Magellan search engine. (My first job post-college). It's been way-back week for me.
maximolly: It *was* my life too! I worked at Netscape in 1996 &amp; 98-99. The final Halt &amp; Catch Fire season made me weep, it was so spot on. Also: chief ontologist!
cwodtke: OMG, that's how I started... building Snap! the Yahoo killer for CNET. LOLS!
mediajunkie: i remember stumbling on yahoo when it was still at ~akebono for our enterzone zine and saying oh look someone else is cataloguing cool stuff on the web, too
janelleb: The good old days, one could say. All seemed so much easier and exciting and clear-cut back then.
maximolly: I liked how possible things seemed. We made Maxi, our webzine because we wanted the voice out there. We knew it would be a success. Maybe not a financial one, but it contributed to a big shift in women‚Äôs media. (And Chickclick sponsoring the Lilith Fair!)
janelleb: Yep. We were just a few years too early to actually monetize Maxi, a la what Jezebel ultimately did. Into the ash-bin of Web history...
carywood: the woman who worked with @johnallsopp, teaching CSS and HMTL. There also was a site to help with all the tricks to make markup work in browsers. Huge following. A man and woman ran it, I think. Anyone know?
stefsull: While I started webbing in 1999, I don't think you could have called me "influential" till later than 2002... I didn't start writing/speaking/teaching till about 2003 and more so in 2004. In was a beautiful time. ;)
carywood: I don't think I was ‚Äúinfluential‚Äù until say 2005, but YOU, @stefsull, had a huge list following you (more than one, actually) wayyyy back when and you were looked at as a leader.
Miraz: Thanks for the mention. üòä I think my chief contribution was teaching beginners (as most everyone was) about Internet, web etc, and how to use them.
johnallsopp: That‚Äôs @Maxine. Also @mholzschlag @stefsull @suesims @rachelandrew to name a few!
dori: It was Maxine Sherrin who worked with @johnallsopp, IIRC.
carywood: I knew it started with an Ma and then it was that name that is on the tip of your tongue that you can't think of. YES!!
johnallsopp: She was smart enough to snag the @Maxine handle
dori: 
I didn't grab https://t.co/Wi3Y52pJo2 early enough, sadly, so I had to pay $$$ to a speculator.
johnallsopp: I think it‚Äôs fairer to say I worked with @Maxine:-)
alicegherbison: Lissa from Lissa Explains. Her site taught children to code. The community was huge - 500,000 page views/month.
tracyulin: Will you post your final list?
ellispratt: Justine Roberts, Mumsnet https://t.co/rmNvgi7xMX
ellispratt: In the UK, Martha Lane Fox
jensimmons: . @jenville @rachelandrew @karenmcgrane @fantasai, Elizabeth Castro, Kathy Sierra‚Ä¶ There are tons. Or were. Many were driven away. Most have had credit for our work stolen by men. Few have Wikipedia entries. Too often, projects  that want to promote women, only want 20-somthngs.
JayGilmore: My early webucation was built around @lizcastro and @mholzschlag and Ms. Robin Williams. Their books gave me a solid foundation to do the web right. Social sexism has left many web pioneers in the dust or to obscurity. Many men have stolen the light from so many.
JayGilmore: 2 decades of mostly male conferences and online magazines that published more articles by men than women with male editors continues to disenchant women in the field.
JayGilmore: I should also note that this is far from unique to the web industry, nor is it new. The white male has dominated and taken credit for change in the world and ignored or suppressed attribution of the work of women and PoC for centuries.
JayGilmore: Of course, women and PoC know this and live with this every day. My comment is for those who wonder if the women and PoC exist in our field. Yes. They. Do.
JayGilmore: And here are just 2 examples of the systemic sexism that women must contend with in the last minute of my feed: https://t.co/3kO4kKZAol https://t.co/AI709WNWUE
WikiWomenInRed: 
But it lacks a picture!!!! Surely someone has a pic of her and understands #creativecommons. You guys are at confs. Take pix of each other! and help yourselves https://t.co/RghKeOh4sr
girlGeek: There were tons, and great mentors. I remember chatting with you Jen at Drupal Con San Fran 2010. How do we change this narrative?
adam_robinson: Like so many others it was @lizcastro book on HTML4 that started me on the path to a career in web development. I still have the book on my bookshelf today.
rachelandrew: Perl and CGI from @lizcastro was my favourite. I learned Perl from ‚ÄúThe Camel Book‚Äù but didn‚Äôt understand how to use it on the web.
carmya: combien de fois j'ai parl√© de toi et ai √©t√© comprise ou seulement prise au s√©rieux qd je parlais de @csswizardry ?
stubbornella: Ah oui? c‚Äôest du n‚Äôimporte quoi! Pas du tout le faute de @csswizardry, il m‚Äôa toujours r√©f√©renc√©.
carmya: Even if I talk about inuit and oocss. And @csswizardry always referenced you.
csswizardry: Nicole is my hero. Learnt so much from her, both technical and non-technical.
stubbornella: Awww, those feels when you are the hero of your heros.
carmya: And you're both my heroes. Your both theories explains the methods I follow and I believe in my work since 10 years. But Nicole is unknown even if you quoted her loudly and that is so unfair. And even if it's not your fault :(
csswizardry: No I totally agree. I always make a point of mentioning her (told a company all about her just yesterday) yet a lot of people think OOCSS etc. was all me and Snook üòî
bowmanthebard: "Many were driven away. Most have had credit for our work stolen by men." Whatever about intimidation &amp; exclusion, plagiarism is quite easy to back up with incontrovertible evidence. Please do so.
EstherWords: I am an active Wikipedia editor and would be honored to work with any of you who are interested in having a Wikipedia page created or enhanced. I know others in the Wiki community would second my words! Ejackson@nybg.org
Grouse_Beater: Can you DM me? Ta.
christinablust: Exactly what I came here to say. Do y‚Äôall know about the @WikiWomenInRed initiative? I‚Äôve participated in lots of their monthly campaigns but they‚Äôre a great force in the Wikipedia sphere.
lessanspagEs: yep and they help other sister projects in other languages too!
WikiWomenInRed: clumsy curtsy and thanks
EstherWords: 
Whether you work with them or not, I think first steps would actually be pretty straight-forward--developing a list of noteworthy folks. Can add resources to use for page creation as next step.
WikiWomenInRed: We have lists and lists of lists. We sort women by job and by nationality etc etc. They are all women who have no wiki article and #Wikipedia colours each one red .... thats where we get our name. We can create you a project ....?
EstherWords: I would gladly contribute to this project!
EstherWords: If you want things to be more complicated you/someone could create a specific Wiki project to manage the work, but with just a list editors can begin.
MrMarkDittmer: "... only want 20-somthngs." Do you have theories (or better yet, data) as to why that is? Projects want "young", "attractive" faces to promote just how progressive they are?
rwaldron: Elizabeth Castro ‚ù§Ô∏è I was super active on her HTML and Perl boards. In 2001 @lizcastro personally mailed me a copy of "Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web, Second Edition" to review and give feedback. That interaction was one of the most important and formative of my life :)
lizcastro: Oh! That is so nice to hear. There were others on those boards who I had a much more difficult relationship with. Never quite got over it.
jensimmons: Hi Liz! Your HTML book was *the* way I learned how to make websites. In 1996. When I had no connections, knew of no one, in a town where no one knew anything about the web, couldn‚Äôt afford internet at home, could only use it a few minutes at a time at work‚Ä¶ then your book!!!
malchata: Just wanted to echo @jensimmons and thank you for your work, @lizcastro. Your HTML guide was my first web development book when I was a teen. Your Perl book introduced me to back end development. I owe much to your work.
lizcastro: At this complicated moment in my life, it is so incredibly heartening to hear how much my work was useful to you. Thank you so much for telling me.
rwaldron: I'm so glad I could tell you!
rwaldron: ü§ó
jensimmons: Thank you @lizcastro. You were the beginning of everything for me.
JiminyPan: And Liz had a huge impact in ebooks as well! As a matter of fact, I believe one of her books is still mentioned in the Kindle Publishing guidelines! üôè
lizcastro: Oh! Wow, that means so much to me. So glad to have been a help.
nickbarreto: Just to add to this I still recommend and give people your book on EPUB today.
lizcastro: Wow, did nobody ever do an EPUB 3 book? Mine is still half done. It was pretty good too. If I could just get this country freed already...
nickbarreto: Even if they have, yours is still a wonderful starting point :D
lizcastro: Oh, you guys are making me nostalgic for those days when I actually knew what I was doing. Thanks!
i_am_not_a__bot: Can you give some examples of credit that was stolen by men?
kscoult: üôÑ
dori: Thank you! It's SO nice to see someone ranting about this who isn't me. üíï
perfmattersconf: 
And of course Kathy Sierra. Thanks to the first master troll, w e e v, she is no longer active online.
shelleypowers: Almost forgot, Jenny Levine
shelleypowers: Also, Wayback Machine for https://t.co/pRFJMz1XZF and go to early days, look for top 100 blogs.
shelleypowers: Suggestion: go to Wayback Machine, enter in https://t.co/MGQBnVuc4I, go to year 2000 and pick a date. Then go to the hot list. You'll see all the movers and shakers of that time. There were a ton of women on this list and elsewhere.
shelleypowers: Meg Hourihan, Mena Trott, Lisa Stone, Heather Armstrong, Rebecca Blood, Jeneane Sessum, Brigitte Eaton, Anita Rowland
jensimmons: Rebecca Blood, @carywood, @halvorson, @stubbornella, @zomigi , @standardista‚Ä¶
fabiovenni: ?
dawnahukanna: is at &gt; 300K.
jensimmons: Yes. And there a plenty of women out there with millions, tech reporters with numbers like 300+, but I was thinking specifically about people who teach how to use HTML/CS/JS, to design websites, etc to compare apples to apples. Reporters different than designers / developers.
carywood: Yes, the threads are getting harder to follow. You did mention that you were talking about women who teach HTML/CSS/Javascript. It just doesn't show up in this part of the thread. Thanks, Twitter. üôÑ
msjen: @dori
carywood: Yes! She's been mentioned a few times, and deservedly so!
msjen: Sorry I didn't flesh out my reply. Let's not forget @dori's contribution in JS, book writing, speaking, etc etc etc!
zomigi: 
But I must admit I've been annoyed at how few people know my contributions to RWD, starting years before it was given a catchy name and continuing after.
jensimmons: Mica, Charlene invented videoblogging in 2003-2005, (before YouTube or Vimeo or anything was founded)
irinaslutsky: That's very sweet and maybe hyperbole in my case there are many more folks we were there together right @ekai  @Schlomo @kentnichols etc etc etc
stubbornella: of course! Yes, Kathy Sierra. @wendyabc. So many talented women.
wmwalsh: Lynda Weinman was major also. And I‚Äôm thinking about Susan McPhee and Dani Nordin here in Massachusetts who encouraged Design in Drupal.
wmwalsh: A related issue is women getting stuck in permanent n00b status in companies. Pay your dues but have to start over to get to the next level.
plasticmind: I miss @seriouspony :(
carywood: My God, don't we all! What a loss that was for everyone!
plasticmind: I got to meet her in person at SXSW, and she was wonderful. Definitely an inspiration to me.
stubbornella: Same for me at foo camp. She‚Äôs super smart.
wendyabc: I met her at foo camp, too. She helped me realize that to reach more developers about accessibility I'd have to find better ways to engage them..."before their eyes glazed over." It shifted how I approached people who are new to accessibility....still to this day.
robinberjon: Liddy Neville, Libby Miller come to mind too. Sharon Adler! So much we take for granted was initially invented by a previous generation of markup people whom we've largely forgotten about.
stubbornella: Yeeees, those are good ones.
kissane: add Leslie Harpold, Liz Danzico, @kristastevens, @rlovinger
stubbornella: Liz! Yes.
claudiopro: May I give a shout out to @ellomumsy while we're at it?
carywood: Was she influential in making the web in the years 1995-2002? Then, yes!
ellomumsy: Wow, Claudio, thanks. I wasn't well-known or anything, Carolyn, but I constantly tried to push my company towards current web trends/standards/accessibility. A small voice in a huge company. PS I started in 1995 but retired a couple of years ago.
claudiopro: You were doing OOCSS, accessibility, style guides and pattern libraries before they became mainstream, and constantly strove to improve portfolio consistency and developer experience. True star üöÄ
carywood: I don't think people who weren't working on the web back then would even believe the arguments against web standards that we heard. A huge amount of resistance, mainly because it was new. Is that your memory of it?
ellomumsy: Yup! But I wouldn't shut up, and I introduced them in any code I wrote. Also got really good at x-browser debugging because designers wanted pixel parity across browsers. Long struggle. The performance argument helped when trying to get people to stop with nested tables.
carywood: He might not name you as an influential person in his article, for practical reasons, but, yes, it's people like you battling for web standards, day after day, year after year, that made everything we have now possible. What an incredible struggle that was.
mholzschlag: Is. Present tense. Emphasis on tense üòÇ
lazycoder: Also @shelleypowers
tobie: Yup. Dearly miss Kathy Sierra's voice.
carywood: Me, too. I'm sure there are many, many people who feel this way.
stubbornella: Ooh @vpieters was super inspiring too.
vpieters: Humbled to hear that Nicole üòò
carywood: Yes! @vpieters talked about CSS, did tutorials, showed how to design things like a designer, back when the majority of sites were ugly and amateurish in appearance.
vpieters: Back in the day loooong time ago üòÅ üòò
stefsull: was an early web pioneer... She's still going strong and gives so much with her amazing bilingual abilities.
vpieters: Thanks Stephanie! üòò
mholzschlag: I remember at Web Directions North and how @mezzoblue interviewed you. Most folks are terrified are public speaking, but you worked through it and inspired so many of us with your wonderful uplifting design. Miss you always xo
vpieters: Oh I remember it vividly how nervous I was. Your support helped. Most of us got pretty sick at that conference too. That was some nasty bug :) Miss you too üòò
girlGeek: I totally remember that! My friend @Erin and I attended that conference. Being in a sea of a mostly male audience, we were elated to have women represent. I also learned a lot from @vpieters back in the early days. ‚ù§Ô∏è
vpieters: Thanks Diana :)
stefsull: Did you ski with us the last day? (So much fun!)
vpieters: Yes I did, but it wasn‚Äôt as much fun as it should have been as I was already getting pretty sick. The rest of the trip we stayed in the room with that nasty bug. The flight home was hell and back home it got even worse. Never been that sick like that and for so long.
stefsull: 
Jeez, I miss you two!!
vpieters: At least I got to know Buckley's thanks to Cindy and because of that she met Matt :) Same here, we need to go eat some asparagus again üòÅ
stefsull: But this time, I should not have food poisoning... :P
jensimmons: One of these years we might just get up the guts to map the work we invented and pioneered to the men who get all the public credit for it. Like‚Ä¶ OOCSS being renamed and repackaged ‚Äî talked about as the ‚Äúnew brand‚Äù by everyone while, uh, Nicole you were doing it *long* before‚Ä¶
kitt: I wish you'd let the OOCSS vs SMACSS torch go. He put in a LOT of effort, he worked for his success. He started building an audience a decade before this "new brand" success. I fail to understand why you are so dismissive of all that work.
jay_hoffmann: I would be extremely interested in that. I‚Äôve uncovered a couple while digging into things for my newsletter.
stubbornella: 5 years. And that‚Äôs just publicly . ;)
ChrisFerdinandi: That one drives me nuts! Nicole, truly, thank you! You changed the way I write CSS for the better!
stubbornella: Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
jpamental: It makes me happy how long I had an actual printed copy of @Natbat 's talk on CSS architecture, paired with @stubbornella 's on OOCS (circa 2009 or 10?) and how much they influenced my understanding of good CSS. (I still think in terms of 'page furniture')
Natbat: That‚Äôs lovely to hear :)
jpamental: Thank you for sharing!
bradwestfall: Can you elaborate on OOCSS being renamed and repackaged, I'm genuinely curious, but understand if you don't want to call out others
carywood: I really don't think we should turn this into an investigation of individual cases. It's the trends that make things meaningful for all of us. Thanks for listening!
NotRenton: Wait who's getting credit for OOCSS if not @stubbornella!? üòÆ
carywood: I think we're here to champion the women, not attack the men.
jensimmons: I‚Äôve also been trying to muster up the guts to write about the sexism measured in Twitter follower stats: mholzschlag 28k / zeldman 357k; karenmcgrane 43k / beep 91k; stubbornella 36k / snookca 53k; standardista 9k / meyerweb 106k; fantasai 2k / tabatkins 4k‚Ä¶ on and on.
_binary_solo: Holy shit, I am so guilty of perpetuating this balance without even realising it. Off to make amends.
suthecoder: And retweet rates by race and gender, both who gets retweeted &amp; whom the big names retweet.
cariefisher: along those same lines, there is a program that can tell you how many of your Twitter followers/people you follow are men/women/nonbinary/no gender listed. i try to keep the balance even, but tough sometimes https://t.co/zjhnnjsxpY
carywood: Wow! This is amazing. I'll try it later!
lizcastro: This is also very true in (my new field of) Catalan independence activism, and I'm sure in other fields as well. It's very frustrating. This is pretty interesting and indicative: https://t.co/nZNS22xrHc
martsky: And then when I realised I wasn't following Molly and went to fix that, twitter gives me this: https://t.co/NBeNrDIKfd
mholzschlag: If a picture were a thousand words, eh?
martsky: Wonder how many refreshes it would have taken to get to get past the guys?
stubbornella: Duuuudes, all the way down
mariawarnes: Thanks for the list of awesome women! Just went on a following spree :)
aburone: That's women who worked along with men? Like: Molly worked with Jeffrey and Jeffrey got all the followers? Or it's just woman / men in no particular order? Just Curious. Thanks
jensimmons: They are paired because their work is similar. Length of time, topics talked about, target audiences, etc. Not that they worked together necessarily, but that their work is comparable. That if their genders were reversed, maybe their follower counts would be, too.
aburone: Oh. Now I get it. Thanks üòç
fantasai: Fwiw (not saying this applies to the rest, just to me), I'd credit the delta between me and Tab to his outgoingness. He does more talks and conferences and general engagement with the Internet, and I... have been pretty content to be obscure. ^_^;;
tabatkins: Yeah, I was a nobody until I started actively talking - each conf I get a nice bump in followers.
jensimmons: I can‚Äôt find one woman who teaches web design/development who has more than 50k followers. Yet, for men, many are 300k+, 500k+, up to 1 million. The gap is huge. So frustrating. A clear glass ceiling. Something likely no woman in web tech can cross. Race &amp; racism, too. More so.
frivoal: has 54.2K, but your overall points still stands.
vdebolt: I claimed my own small contribution on https://t.co/UL5BXxd7uV It was more about education method than web design, but still important.
GPHemsley: I think I used to use that site back in the day. I may have even e-mailed you at one point? Thank you for your pioneering efforts.
vdebolt: I've let it go lately. Can't decide if I should leave it up or take it down. Thank you for your comment.
carywood: Yes, it was, and I'm sorry I didn't think to mention it last night when this thread started!
vdebolt: Something Jen didn‚Äôt list that I certainly dealt with was ageism
mholzschlag: Again, a situation where there are plenty of older folks in the industry but not as the face of it. There is also a damning bit of "youth is more important in edge tech" mentality which only we older folk understand is truly a mistake of youth.
mholzschlag: I love that you have the confidence to know your work has mattered Virginia. You too have run a long long career course without much public recognition. Every time you post I am comforted as for me, your longevity and commitment to excellence in industry is profound indeed. ThxU!
vdebolt: Well now you made me cry. Thank you.
mholzschlag: Tears of joy I hope. Or love/moved. Noes to be sadz xo
vdebolt: Tears of joy. Wonderful to be acknowledged by anyone but especially you.
mholzschlag: Pass me the tissues please? Now I'm all mollymush xo
coates: Agreed on that mistake. And thanks for replying.
vdebolt: Thank you.
i_am_not_a__bot: There is such a thing as personal choice you may want to take into consideration before assuming racism &amp; sexism https://t.co/JHxpJN1oBo
daveed_kz: @sarah_edo
SaraSoueidan: üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
callmevlad: Don‚Äôt forget @vpieters (almost 200K) - I learned more from her and @LeaVerou than anyone else when I was learning web design ‚úåÔ∏è
teleclimber: You're at 54k?? üò± You rock Sara, congratulations! üéâ
SaraSoueidan: Thank you Olivier üòä
jnfsmile: @SaraSoueidan
stubbornella: Yep, and Lea Verou
stubbornella: Lea maybe?
jensimmons: Yes. She‚Äôs at 97k.
LeaVerou: Jen‚Äôs point still stands though. 97K &lt;&lt; 500K
drifterz28: I have learned more from the 3 of you than anyone else! As a man I am happy to follow, retweet and give you all the credit you deserve!
jensimmons: Yes. Men with far less on their r√©sum√© than Lea have 150k+.
blind3y3design: Been an in/off listener to the RWD podcast with Karen and Ethan, and I did enjoy the fact that she is first to speak and ‚Äúyour host,‚Äù while Ethan is ‚Äúyour other host.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small difference, but if you‚Äôre equal why not put the female name first?
stubbornella: It does. A man who had done everything you have would likely have more.
NoelDeMartin: Just out of curiosity, why do you think this happens? I am following both Nicole and Lea, but yes I follow more men if we look at the % of people I follow. Is that because there is some people in the chain of influence who actively sabotage women? Or is it a subconcious thing?
NoelDeMartin: I can only talk for myself, but I don't think people actively choose to follow someone or not based on their gender, so the only explanations I can think about are those two.
LeaVerou: Its subconscious. Women are less visible, less talked about, less promoted, less self-promoting.
NoelDeMartin: Damn, if it's true that's a shame, I hope with time society gets better about this.
keithjgrant: I have a hard time picturing a man open a talk with a ‚Äúgeographically Lesbian‚Äù joke üòú
LeaVerou: Why? The whole point is that Lesbian actually means someone from the island of Lesbos. Both men and women live in Lesbos, therefore there are plenty of men who are geographically Lesbian. My father for example!
keithjgrant: You‚Äôre right. I was picturing a dudebro doing it, which felt incongruent. But someone actually from the island? Makes more sense.
AJKandy: Sorry, who‚Äôs Lea? (Now following all the names I wasn‚Äôt previously familiar with, so thank you all.)
stubbornella: Lea Verou
aburone: Lea Verou @LeaVerou
AJKandy: Ah of course! Thx
stubbornella: I never looked at it like that... makes it seem pretty systemic
jensimmons: It‚Äôs a vicious circle. We can‚Äôt get verified, because we don‚Äôt have enough followers. We aren‚Äôt on Wikipedia, because we don‚Äôt seem to matter. People don‚Äôt give us credit because they see these men getting all the attention first. And we aren‚Äôt on Wikipedia. We aren‚Äôt verified.
mholzschlag: I blame @twitter fully for this and I am MAD as hell about it personally as they used my face on the home page of https://t.co/wtcWaTD2BA for at least a year without a word to me. Use my face but I'm not verifiable? Wish I could be surprise to learn sellouts sell colleagues out.
mholzschlag: Anyone have @biz Stone's first (I think) book? If so, I would very much like you to look me up in the index and quote him on what it was I did that he said I did. I have wanted to find that quote but all my books are lost to loss. There's a passage there I'd like to revisit help!
biz: Hi Molly! I had my second book on hand. Is this what you mean? I‚Äôll look for book one tomorrow. https://t.co/5fEYfG1JNf
divisao4: Hello Biz, today I will not ask you to check my official account, I'm already becoming a troll, almost. I got tired of asking and I know that twitter doesn't care about me anymore, honestly. I only came to wish that the peace of the Lord that I believe, Jesus Christ, be with you!
standardista: Wow. What a quote. and @mholzschlag can't get verified? There's definitely an issue with gendered imbalanced requirements for getting verified. Not ok.
carywood: It would be so incredible if someone started a Kickstarter project and collected many of the stories and names here, wrote to the ppl in these threads asking for support. If one source considered credible for Wikipedia is books, then those mentions wld help women get in Wikipedia
rachelandrew: I would be totally up for editing a book project on this. I had an idea a while back for a documentary about these women.
mctrebo: There seems to be a way to get verified on Twitter with a little advice from someone who did it ... https://t.co/qBzS4ItXLh
carywood: Thanks for contributing this, Monika. Although the battle continues, I'm sure everyone appreciates that you are on the lookout for anything that can help!
rachelandrew: I applied several times in this way. Rejected each time, so no that doesn‚Äôt work.
jensimmons: We know the advice Kevan writes in that article. I already do all those things &amp; have been rejected multiple times. And I didn't game the system like he did (I actually use Twitter, not bots to fake using Twitter). And yet‚Ä¶ he got "first try!" Hm, I wonder what's different.
mctrebo: Men vs. women = "Whatever works to my advantage" vs. "I want to do it the right way and not game the system". Sad that one gets punished for playing by the rules.
mctrebo: Sorry to hear, @rachelandrew. This is absolutely ridiculous.
carywood: This is pathetic. Something MUST be done about this, though I've given up thinking that any of us can get Twitter to be responsive about ANYTHING.
erikaherzog: I work on addressing the gender gap on @Wikipedia and would be happy to try to work to fix this. Also cc‚Äôing @WikiWomenInRed who have many ongoing outreach efforts
WikiWomenInRed: Jen, this is a great offer. I'm not sure what this "verify" is, you can edit Wikipedia anonymously. With a mate like Erika and a bit of perseverance you can do this. We will support you if you shout "help". There are also real people at @wikimediany who are near to you. - cont.
erikaherzog: The verify in this case I think is having Twitter verify your Twitter account. :-)
WikiWomenInRed: I'd like to offer to RT the first article you help with ..... and the first you start .... and the first you "complete". Tweet your diary here?
LeonieWatson: We can start to change this I think. Is there any reason not to add people to Wikipedia? https://t.co/6YonJxYANT
carywood: We have someone who has Wikipedia experience. She is mentioned a few other times in this massive thread. @christinablunt.
halvorson: Are we sure that's why Twitter isn't verifying? Do they give specific reasons? I would very much like to get to the bottom of this. Also ... can we write our own Wikipedia pages? Because we should.
stubbornella: Wikipedia deletes pages about women. Saying the women aren‚Äôt famous enough. Also, notoriously had a page for authors with no women and a separate page for women authors.
mholzschlag: they're feeding you b.s. - someone made a page for me in the last quarter century (I don't know when) and updates come infrequently but I see them. So there's precedence here, and they need a slap in the wake up face. What makes "famous *enough*" (Outing the truth comes to mind).
carywood: So...@christinablust, do you have any insights about this issue? @stubbornella, maybe someone who wants a page should work with someone who wants to write one, perhaps @christinablust, and report back to everyone about whether it is accepted or not?
stubbornella: Two times someone created a Wikipedia entry for me and twice it has been deleted. You can see it was linked from here: https://t.co/lxGQ1W5UKN
wendyabc: WTF?!
carywood: Yeah, it seems outrageous just on the face of it. I'm trying to find out why, say, SASS would be eligible, but not OOCSS. This is how to build a case. Find something that would be sort of equivalent (what would that be?) and asking why not OOCSS?
carywood: I take it there was no explanation. So, @christinablust, do you know anything about the process? Or, the requirements for an article about this to be accepted?
christinablust: I have lots of thoughts! My decade in the Wikipedia-sphere has given me some good insights and battle scars. It‚Äôs a bit like lobbying ‚Äî knowing how to work within the system to change the system. Tomorrow I think I‚Äôll pull some guidelines/tips together to share. Go team.
mctrebo: I created my account with Wikipedia a few days ago. Guidelines /tips would be much appreciated.
mholzschlag: I'd love that too. I read the compliance docs on Wikipedia itself but my processing unit just cannot parse some of the contradictions and semantics in use there. Not to mention the massive amount of stuff that makes no sense. To me at least.
mholzschlag: Christina, lead us! I would put some time as I am able to help with getting better representation on Wikipedia. Haz battle scars, Jersey baditude and even special system change ops skillz! Let's excise the misogyny outta any "progressive" media. Which @Wikipedia apparently isn't.
christinablust: Let‚Äôs do this. :) Luckily a lot of article writing on Wikipedia is based in simple wiki-coded formatting, pulling the right templates in at the right times, and imitating good examples...which I think web developers like y‚Äôall will find quite familiar.
christinablust: .@WikiWomenInRed would an auto-generated list for occupation: web developer Q6859455, plus a focus area page to add to manually, be the best place to start? I could probably figure out the SPARQL query but you may have better ideas/standard processes
WikiWomenInRed: 
https://t.co/osZ75xZhNF
christinablust: Alright! It‚Äôs only a first part of a topic I have lots to say about, but here‚Äôs some thoughts. https://t.co/Xz3WT66bC9
carywood: Fantastic! Going to read this today! I am SO GLAD that you did this. I would really like to see some specific actions and projects come out of this awesome thread. Thank you for helping us turn this from conversation to change. @jensimmons maybe you can retweet her article?
carywood: This would be fantastic!
stubbornella: Oooh, please share!
christinablust: It‚Äôs frowned upon to write one‚Äôs own article ‚Äî but what would be great is a community of tech ladies more active in Wikipedia, feeling empowered to write the articles they see are missing. We need more ladies in general! I‚Äôd love to help anyone with questions/how-tos, for real.
christinablust: For years now I‚Äôve been adding ladies to Wikipedia as I can, so maybe I‚Äôll focus on this topic for a bit. I started (rather arbitrarily) with a base article of @rachelandrew today, just to dip my toes in. üôÇ https://t.co/qIO9agFSzs
carywood: Fantastic. A great choice! It's so amazing that you are tackling this.
mholzschlag: Excellent idea, Christina! This is great - one giant leap forward for womankind ;-) xo
dylanw: (Psst... there's a model you can work from if you want to make it this A Thing: https://t.co/JdJoNIvWkG)
christinablust: Absolutely! WikiProjects are magic. (Another great one is Women in Red, which aims to get more women represented.) They can provide guidance, community and credibility to whatever you‚Äôre working on.
stubbornella: Sadly, the pages get deleted. But please don‚Äôt let that stop you trying. I would have thought being referenced by another page would have been enough to keep mine from being deleted, but no.
KR15KR15:

tiny_m: Wikipedia also renowned for having an anti-woman bias and actively removing articles relating to women or women's projects because they aren't deemed "important" enough
MetastaticAngel: It isn't about importance but "notability": base requirements are that topics need in-depth independent published reliable sources to establish notability. Wikipedia is a follower, not a leader.
tiny_m: Ok. If you want to split hairs about 'notability' being different to 'important' and that makes you feel clever, whatever. The point is the arbiters of 'notability' are biased and make decisions which actively harm the promotion of women's work. The end result is the same.
carywood: This person wasn't "splitting hairs or trying to be clever." They were trying to give us information about how Wikipedia operates, and went on, over the next few tweets, to give us good info. In fact, people should look below to find that information. Very helpful!
MetastaticAngel: Notability is a term of art on Wikipedia. Wikipedia sums up what reliable sources say.. which has nothing to do with importance. The problem is really that there's a lack of coverage of women.
carywood: Thanks for the clarification! And I'm assuming that, frequently, the only or primary ‚Äúreliable sources‚Äù they'll accept are things like newspaper articles or books or professional journals. So, you're correct, that would be stacked against women. Ugh.
MetastaticAngel: See https://t.co/e3XWz75e0e for a detailed description. News is generally acceptable, as are books and journals, but blogs and random sites aren't. It's this that makes Wikipedia stacked against women. And it sucks but I don't know how to fix it.
carywood: Thanks for this information! I guess we'll need to look at the sources that were used for those other things I mentioned (CSS, etc.) and then work on how to get the same sort of coverage. What a battle.
standardista: I guess, step 1, would be to add each other on wikipedia. We should all be there already, but don't think any of us are. There are definitely men in our industry on there who have done much less.
MetastaticAngel: Yes, it's a huge battle and very frustrating because women have not received the same level of coverage as men have. And it's mostly men who wrote history which has also excluded women. The Wikipedia Women and Women in Red do great work and can help, especially at AfD.
carywood: There are articles about SASS, Responsive web design, CSS, etc. How do we figure out why SASS would be more "notable‚Äú than Nicole's work? Do you happen to know?  @stubbornella, @jensimmons
MetastaticAngel: If sources that have a reputation for fact-checking and that are independent of Nicole were to write indepth features on her (not interviews!) outlining her biography and achievements, that would establish notability. Usually need at least two of these to survive AfD.
carywood: Great information. Thanks so much for sharing this! Can you tell me what "AfD" is?
MetastaticAngel: Sorry - AfD is "Articles for Discussion". If another editor thinks the article subject isn't notable, they tag it for AfD. The discussion there determines whether an article is kept, merged, redirected, or deleted.
MetastaticAngel: It's all about what reliable sources have said. Without looking too deeply, there's lots of independent coverage for sass/CSS/etc, but there isn't coverage of Nicole herself. And on Wikipedia a person isn't notable just because they've done something notable.
tiny_m: And more "importantly" It's totally irrelevant if you know how to write Sass, CSS, or RWD because unless you have also read and understood OOCSS then you're ability to implement it usefully or to even grasp the basic fundamentals of writing elegant maintainable CSS is unlikely
carywood: Are you talking to me? I'm not talking about the relevancy of SASS, CSS or RWD. I'm asking why there are articles about them, but not about OOCSS. I'm trying to find out Wikipedia's reasoning, in case that person knows. Knowing the reasoning would help us.
tiny_m: No I'm suggesting having articles about the others and not Nicole's work or OOCSS is absurd because its one of the fundamental learnings from front end development.
carywood: That's why I'm asking the person about it.
ShaneHudson: Even Lynda (who Wikipedia says sold her business for $1bn+) has less followers than me
ShaneHudson: (partly due to inactivity, but still)
agcolom: I‚Äôve definitely noticed that the male web people I follow become verified while female don‚Äôt. The same also with the university profs I follow... male with 7k followers is verified, female (also web speaker) 12k followers unverified! It‚Äôs ridiculous!
rachelandrew: Oh yes, and men getting attention for stuff they have pestered us for information about while they worked on it.
rachelandrew: That‚Äôs the one that most bothers me. Not only are they reframing my stuff, not crediting me, but using my time to help them do so!
carywood: Or, a man will take the work you and/or @jensimmons have done, repackage it, and even if they give you credit, the general web community responds in droves to what he does, rather than the more pioneering work you two have done. He becomes the known expert then. Aggravating!!!!
jensimmons: Yup. I‚Äôm bracing myself for an onslaught in this in 2018. I see it coming.
rachelandrew: Over and over again. For nearly 20 years, and the people who do this don‚Äôt realise how much they are benefiting from the status quo.
rachelandrew: Need to make sure as an industry we highlight the people who aren‚Äôt shouting ‚Äúlook at me!‚Äù and just doing the work quietly.
mediajunkie: when I wrote a book with @emalone i frequently had to insist on her getting equal billing in mentions
stubbornella: Thanks for doing it!
mediajunkie: literally the least i could do, and sucks i would even have to :\
accessiblestef: 
Perhaps writing the story as it goes is a good way to not forget who originated what.
accessiblestef: Side note: maybe it's because I'm a groupie (or naive) but for me when I think "grid CSS" I think Rachel, OOCSS equals Nicole, etc.
mholzschlag: As it should be. I credit Paris Web for this.
accessiblestef: 
Again, I may be naive or see only part of the story.
carywood: I so wish that were true. It's probably something that you can't imagine doing, so it's hard to wrap your head around it being widespread enough that many women can say, ‚ÄúThat happened to me.‚Äù
coates: As a whole, I absolutely agree with you. There are lots of people behind the scenes, of all walks of life. This is more of a nostalgia project, so the overlap with "quiet" isn't super important here. Still very interesting to read the responses.
SirMontyTheDog: 
[Enter @coates]: yeah I'm only interested in people like you [Guy]
idiot_girl: This response is quite tone deaf.
carywood: His article is whatever he wants it to be. As he invited women to help him remember the most influential women from 1995-2002, we sort of got into our own definitions and our own topics as a sub-thread.
idiot_girl: But the fact that there wasn‚Äôt zero ability to recall an influential woman of the time for nostalgia paired with the ‚ÄúThere are many people in the background..‚Äù comment doesn‚Äôt give you just a moment of pause?
carywood: I'm sorry, I feel like you're having an argument that I haven't been part of. All I'm saying is that @coates isn't responsible for writing the history of women on the internet. He isn't writing abt ‚Äúprojects.‚Äù He wants to write a ‚ÄúRemember when‚Äù piece. That's it.
carywood: All he's saying is, from what I can tell, that yes, that's all important, but the article he wants to write is a sort of ‚ÄúHey! Remember when all these great women were doing stuff that we as a group admired?" It isn't an academic or exhaustive historical piece.
coates: To be clear, I don't think I said anything about writing. I'm at the "collect a list and see if it's interesting" stage for the project (which may turn into audio of some sort, or may not). And also, it's not exclusively about women, I just wanted to be inclusive.
standardista: Please make sure the list isn't all white, and, if possible, not all binary gendered. Thanks for what you do.
carywood: I'm about to go to sleep, so I don't have time to look for it, but @blogdiva said that somewhere in these threads, some WOC were mentioned in a series of tweets. Maybe search her name to find?
carywood: I'd bet everyone wld love to hear those names! There's no one making a list. I'd love to see actions come from this, likely many others are, too. If you want to bring up ANY influential women from 1995-2002, your contributions are very welcome. No one is in charge, so have at it!
carywood: I also think it would be great if someone started an entirely new thread that talks about any other aspect of women who built the web we know today, whether it's since 2002 or important work that the women involved never received acclaim for, etc. More of these community lists!
carywood: Yes, sorry, I got that. I meant that the article, assuming you write one, would specifically include women who were doing great things that we as a group admired. A sort of golden oldies. I have many fond memories of that time, too! Amazing battles were fought that help us now.
idiot_girl: I guess my main point was that in your time experiencing the web as a beginner you collected references and reverence for projects and their creators so that at this point in your future, you can look back on them w/ nostalgia. My issue is during all that time, you did not ..
idiot_girl: .. collect more than a couple female names to the point where you're struggling to fill out the list w/ women even though women were pretty prevalent in the field back then AND you did recognize, revere, and remember the men?
idiot_girl: How can you talk about all the work we admired without referencing the fact that the women who did the work were not properly admired for the work they did? I just seems that you can‚Äôt write about admiration of projects without referencing the (at the time) lack of admiration
carywood: I think there is infinite room for articles and if you want to write an article about the women who weren't known widely, the rest of us would really welcome it. Just tell someone who has appeared in these threads, who has a lot of followers. I'm sure they'd announce it!
stubbornella: I think the frustration you are hearing is that many of these ladies were not quiet, but their ideas only really took off when championed/renamed/appropriated by a man. And then history erases and they never existed.
seaotta: You know what kills me about reading this, I had a woman try to do this to me. She only ever names the men on the project and even when sharing parts that I specifically worked on, would not name me. It sucks when it's men, but when women do it, it feels so much worse.
SaraSoueidan: Yup been there. I had a woman once ask me for help on something that wasn‚Äôt working for her, so I helped her make it work. Then when she published it she thanked a few ppl who had helped her but not me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I really don‚Äôt care too much but like u said it‚Äôs worse there.
stubbornella: It‚Äôs important to remember we all bathe in sexism from birth... not just men. :(
SaraSoueidan: I just think of stuff like that as valuable lessons, and then I move on. It‚Äôs not so easy (far from it actually!) when it happens often, of course.
SaraSoueidan: Sexism, and, in my theory, that particular incident had to do with more than that (she did thank other women, just not me). Shrug. üòä
seaotta: (I hope this doesn't come off like I'm trying to say my experience was worse.) Anyone, regardless of their gender, taking credit or trying to re-write what other women have done is a frustrating feeling period. This just stirred up some things I've experienced w/women. üòï
mholzschlag: Nicole, that is exactly it. A perfect articulation of how I feel and have felt for a very long time. Thank you for "getting it" both on the human and tech levels, and challenging status quo always. ‚ù§Ô∏è
sthomas451: Also, thank you, thank you, thank you. üòäüíØüíØüíØ...
sthomas451: I just added several of the suggestions above to my feed and without fail, all of the subsequent Twitter-generated suggestions were men. It's self-feeding üòî
mholzschlag: Of course it is. I could point fingers and vilify and tell you how that happened, but I'd rather honor than deride at this point. We all play a part, all of us!
mholzschlag: I'm really glad, Sean! You clearly asked an important question with tentacles to other important questions I believe we need to iteratively make part of our knowledge-sharing process. The Web is for the many, not the few or the one üññ ‚ù§Ô∏èüíöüíô
rachelandrew: occurs to me as I head onto the CSS WG call, how many of the women mentioned spent more time contributing than self-promoting.
carywood: I believe this has happened to @stefsull, too. She has had the experience I bet you've had, in which a well-known man doesn't do a great job and she has to go in and clean it up later. He gets credit; she doesn't.
mperrien: Being french (maybe the numbers are different) I see many french verified accounts with less followers than you.
jensimmons: I see many verified accounts with fewer followers than me. But Twitter keeps rejecting me over and over. Along with most of my female colleagues. Because we don‚Äôt matter enough. I don‚Äôt know how they measure, but somehow it‚Äôs gender x race x follower count, or something.
mperrien: I guess it‚Äôs a ¬´¬†manual¬†¬ª process isn‚Äôt it ? Don‚Äôt you know anyone at Twitter who could enlighten on the subject, even off the record ?
mperrien: I think that verification thing is even more important than the gap in followers, as it depends on a small number of people not doing right.
stubbornella: and @marlenac come to mind too.
ellispratt: Esther Dyson, perhaps?  EDventure,  early investor, Founding chairman of ICANN etc
sevapetrov: That way lies the road to controversy and dischord. üò∂
Snaggy: Gotta add @Nitrozac to that list üò¨
lxt: How about @MitchellBaker?
MitchellBaker: yup, i started working on the web in 1994 just before Netscape Navigator 1.0 release. Danese Cooper is another @DivaDanese .  Stormy Peters ran the Open Source program office at HP during that time, so she's another
MitchellBaker: also @fantasai, css guru, marcia knous of mozilla
atlemo: Molly @mholzschlag for sure
JessicaRGleason: Neopets co-founder Donna Williams, perhaps? I was a kid at the time, so from my perspective...
geriellen: How about Evi Nemeth?  https://t.co/svttAjpEn5
antimoof: And Sue Hares ran the GateD consortium, which ran much of the internet in the NSFnet days.
fladamd: I loved her sysadmin books so much.
ReninaWrites: Define active and influential....
coates: Hard to define. I'm looking for a list of people who would be somehow generally known to people working on the web during that time. Current list includes people like @cmdrtaco, @rasmus, and @ArcaneSecure (Mafiaboy) etc.
abritinthebay: Not tech CEOs then? I know the LastMinute CEO was a woman and that was one of the big Bubble IPOs
abritinthebay: 
Very impressive individual.
zoonini: founded Webgrrls, @lynda started her empire, @dori was writing about JavaScript, for starters...
knitgrrl: I ran a Webgrrls chapter! (Thank you for tagging me in @LeannePrain!) üôåüèª
alizasherman: Thanks for the mention @zoonini - I did start the 1st woman-owned, full-service Internet company in 1995 - Cybergrrl, Inc. - and the 1st organization for women to learn about the Internet - Webgrrls International. Left in 1999. Now running a cannabis startup @EllementaWoman
coates: Thanks. Very helpful!
dori: 
And you have to include @lemay and @lizcastro, as just two more quick (and best-selling) examples.
lizcastro: How about Robin Williams, @LyndaWeinman @SharonSteuer @mholzschlag, Linnea Dayton, @mlanger, @elaineweinmann, @kissane, @SharonZardetto, Kathy Sierra (Thanks, @dori!)
